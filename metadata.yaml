description: Tall and burly, with features and skin hardened by exposure to the sun
  and winds of many climates, he looked like a man ready to face all hardships, equal
  to any emergency. Already one seemed to see the clothes and habits of civilization
  falling away from him, the former to be replaced by the stern, unlovely outfit of
  the war correspondent who plays the game. They crowded round him in the club smoking
  room, for these were his last few minutes.
