    <h2>
      A SOCIETY SCANDAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tall and burly, with features and skin hardened by exposure to the sun and
      winds of many climates, he looked like a man ready to face all hardships,
      equal to any emergency. Already one seemed to see the clothes and habits
      of civilization falling away from him, the former to be replaced by the
      stern, unlovely outfit of the war correspondent who plays the game. They
      crowded round him in the club smoking room, for these were his last few
      minutes. They had dined him, toasted him, and the club loving cup had been
      drained to his success and his safe return. For Lovell was a popular
      member of this very Bohemian gathering, and he was going to the Far East,
      at a few hours&rsquo; notice, to represent one of the greatest of English
      dailies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pale, slight young man, who stood at this right hand, was speaking. His
      name was Walter Aynesworth, and he was a writer of short stories&mdash;a
      novelist in embryo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I envy you most, Lovell,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;is your escape from the
      deadly routine of our day by day life. Here in London it seems to me that
      we live the life of automatons. We lunch, we dine, we amuse or we bore
      ourselves, and we sleep&mdash;and all the rest of the world does the same.
      Passion we have outgrown, emotion we have destroyed by analysis. The
      storms which shake humanity break over other countries. What is there left
      to us of life? Civilization ministers too easily to our needs, existence
      has become a habit. No wonder that we are a tired race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is the same, the world over,&rdquo; another man remarked. &ldquo;With every
      forward step in civilization, life must become more mechanical. London is
      no worse than Paris, or Paris than Tokyo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It is
      the same, more or less, with all European countries, but the Saxon
      temperament, with its mixture of philosophy and philistinism, more than
      any other, gravitates towards the life mechanical. Existence here has
      become fossilized. We wear a mask upon our faces; we carry a gauge for our
      emotions. Lovell is going where the one great force of primitive life
      remains. He is going to see war. He is going to breathe an atmosphere hot
      with naked passion; he is going to rub shoulders with men who walk hand in
      hand with death. That&rsquo;s the sort of tonic we all want, to remind us that
      we are human beings with blood in our veins, and not sawdust-stuffed
      dolls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Lovell broke silence. He took his pipe from his mouth, and he
      addressed Aynesworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are talking rot. There is nothing very complex or
      stimulating about the passion of war, when men kill one another unseen;
      where you feel the sting in your heart which comes from God knows where,
      and you crumple up, with never a chance to have a go at the chap who has
      potted you from the trenches, or behind a rock, a thousand yards off. Mine
      is going to be, except from a spectacular point of view, a very barren
      sort of year, compared with what yours might be if the fire once touched
      your eyes. I go where life is cruder and fiercer, perhaps, but you remain
      in the very city of tragedies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth laughed, as he lit a fresh cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;City of tragedies!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It sounds all right, but it&rsquo;s bunkum
      all the same. Show me where they lie, Lovell, old chap. Tell me where to
      stir the waters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several of those who were watching him noticed a sudden change in Lovell&rsquo;s
      face. The good humor and bonhomie called up by this last evening amongst
      his old friends had disappeared. His face had fallen into graver lines,
      his eyes seemed fixed with a curious introspective steadiness on a huge
      calendar which hung from the wall. When at last he turned towards
      Aynesworth, his tone was almost solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them don&rsquo;t lie so very far from the surface, Walter,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;There is one&rdquo;&mdash;he took out his watch&mdash;&ldquo;there is one which, if
      you like, I will tell you about. I have just ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, Lovell, old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a drink first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. They were all silent. He stood up amongst them, by
      far the tallest man there, with his back to the chimney piece, and his
      eyes still lingering about that calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirteen years ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;two young men&mdash;call them by their
      Christian names, Wingrave and Lumley&mdash;shared a somewhat extensive
      hunting box in Leicestershire. They were both of good family, well off,
      and fairly popular, Lumley the more so perhaps. He represented the
      ordinary type of young Englishman, with a stronger dash than usual of
      selfishness. Wingrave stood for other things. He was reticent and
      impenetrable. People called him mysterious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell paused for a moment to refill his pipe. The sudden light upon his
      face, as he struck a match, seemed to bring into vivid prominence
      something there, indescribable in words, yet which affected his hearers
      equally with the low gravity of his speech. The man himself was feeling
      the tragedy of the story he told.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seemed,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;always to get on well together, until they
      fell in love with the same woman. Her name we will say was Ruth. She was
      the wife of the Master of Hounds with whom they hunted. If I had the
      story-writing gifts of Aynesworth here, I would try to describe her. As I
      haven&rsquo;t, I will simply give you a crude idea of what she seemed like to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was neither dark nor fair, short nor tall; amongst a crowd of other
      women, she seemed undistinguishable by any special gifts; yet when you had
      realized her there was no other woman in the room. She had the eyes of an
      angel, only they were generally veiled; she had the figure of a miniature
      Venus, soft and with delicate curves, which seemed somehow to be always
      subtly asserting themselves, although she affected in her dress an almost
      puritanical simplicity. Her presence in a room was always felt at once.
      There are some women, beautiful or plain, whose sex one scarcely
      recognizes. She was not one of these! She seemed to carry with her the
      concentrated essence of femininity. Her quiet movements, the almost
      noiseless rustling of her clothes, the quaint, undistinguishable perfumes
      which she used, her soft, even voice, were all things which seemed
      individual to her. She was like a study in undernotes, and yet&rdquo;&mdash;Lovell
      paused a moment&mdash;&ldquo;and yet no Spanish dancing woman, whose dark eyes
      and voluptuous figure have won her the crown of the demi-monde, ever
      possessed that innate and mystic gift of kindling passion like that woman.
      I told you I couldn&rsquo;t describe her! I can&rsquo;t! I can only speak of effects.
      If my story interests you, you must build up your own idea of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Becky Sharpe!&rdquo; Aynesworth murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovell nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;only Ruth was a lady. To go on with my story. A
      hunting coterie, as you fellows know, means lots of liberty, and a general
      free-and-easiness amongst the sexes, which naturally leads to flirtations
      more or less serious. Ruth&rsquo;s little affairs were either too cleverly
      arranged, or too harmless for gossip. Amongst the other women of the hunt,
      she seemed outwardly almost demure. But one day&mdash;there was a row!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell paused, and took a drink from a glass by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you fellows won&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m spinning this out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
      is, after all, in itself only a commonplace story, but I&rsquo;ve carried it
      locked up in my memory for years, and now that I&rsquo;ve let it loose, it
      unwinds itself slowly. This is how the row came about. Lumley one
      afternoon missed Wingrave and Ruth from the hunting field. Someone most
      unfortunately happened to tell him that they had left the run together,
      and had been seen riding together towards White Lodge, which was the name
      of the house where these two young men lived. Lumley followed them. He
      rode into the stable yard, and found there Ruth&rsquo;s mare and Wingrave&rsquo;s
      covert hack, from which he had not changed when they had left the field.
      Both animals had evidently been ridden hard, and there was something
      ominous in the smile with which the head groom told him that Lady Ruth and
      Wingrave were in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two men had separate dens. Wingrave&rsquo;s was much the better furnished,
      as he was a young man of considerable taste, and he had also fitted it
      with sporting trophies collected from many countries. This room was at the
      back of the house, and Lumley deliberately crossed the lawn and looked in
      at the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell paused for a moment or two to relight his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that I have to put this story together, partly
      from facts which came to my knowledge afterwards, and partly from
      reasonable deductions. I may say at once that I do not know what Lumley
      saw when he played the spy. The housekeeper had just taken tea in, and it
      is possible that Wingrave may have been holding his guest&rsquo;s hand, or that
      something in their faces or attitude convinced him that his jealousy was
      well founded. Anyhow, it is certain that Lumley was half beside himself
      with rage when he strode away from that window. Then in the avenue he must
      have heard the soft patter of hounds coming along the lane, or perhaps
      seen the pink coats of the huntsmen through the hedge. This much is
      certain. He hurried down the drive, and returned with Ruth&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell took another drink. No one spoke. No one even made a remark. The
      little circle of listeners had caught something of his own gravity. The
      story was an ordinary one enough, but something in Lovell&rsquo;s manner of
      telling it seemed somehow to bring into their consciousness the
      apprehension of the tangled web of passions which burned underneath its
      sordid details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth&rsquo;s husband&mdash;Sir William I will call him&mdash;stood side by side
      with Lumley before the window. What they saw I cannot tell you. They
      entered the room. The true story of what happened there I doubt if anyone
      will ever know. The evidence of servants spoke of raised voices and the
      sound of a heavy fall. When they were summoned, Sir William lay on the
      floor unconscious. Lady Ruth had fainted; Lumley and Wingrave were both
      bending over the former. On the floor were fragments of paper, which were
      afterwards put together, and found to be the remains of a check for a
      large amount, payable to Lady Ruth, and signed by Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sequel is very soon told. Sir William died in a few days, and
      Wingrave, on the evidence of Lumley and Ruth, was committed for
      manslaughter, and sent to prison for fifteen years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell paused. A murmur went round the little group of listeners. The
      story, after all, except for Lovell&rsquo;s manner of telling it, was an
      ordinary one. Everyone felt that there was something else behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they asked no questions whilst Lovell drank his whisky and soda, and
      refilled his pipe. Again his eyes seemed to wander to the calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to Lady Ruth&rsquo;s evidence,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;her husband
      entered the room at the exact moment when she was rejecting Wingrave&rsquo;s
      advances, and indignantly refusing a check which he was endeavoring to
      persuade her to accept. A struggle followed between the two men, with
      fatal results for Sir William. That,&rdquo; he added slowly, &ldquo;is the story which
      the whole world read, and which most of it believes. Here, however, are a
      few corrections of my own, and a suggestion or two for you, Aynesworth,
      and those of you who like to consider yourselves truth seekers. First,
      then, Lady Ruth was a self-invited guest at White Lodge. She had asked
      Wingrave to return with her, and as they sat together in his room, she
      confessed that she was worried, and asked for his advice. She was in some
      money trouble, ingeniously explained, no doubt. Wingrave, with the utmost
      delicacy, offered his assistance, which was of course accepted. It was
      exactly what she was there for. She was in the act of taking the check,
      when she saw her husband and Lumley. Her reputation was at stake. Her
      subsequent course of action and evidence becomes obvious. The check
      unexplained was ruin. She explained it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the struggle, and of the exact means by which Sir William received his
      injuries, I know nothing. There is the evidence! It may or may not be
      true. The most serious part of the case, so far as Lady Ruth was
      concerned, lay in the facts as to her husband&rsquo;s removal from the White
      Lodge. In an unconscious state he was driven almost twelve miles at a
      walking pace. No stimulants were administered, and though they passed two
      doctors&rsquo; houses no stop was made. A doctor was not sent for until half an
      hour after they reached home, and even then they seemed to have chosen the
      one who lived furthest away. The conclusion is obvious enough to anyone
      who knows the facts of the case. Sir William was not meant to live!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave&rsquo;s trial was a famous one. He had no friends and few
      sympathizers, and he insisted upon defending himself. His cross
      examination of the man who had been his friend created something like a
      sensation. Amongst other things, he elicited the fact that Lumley, after
      first seeing the two together, had gone and fetched Sir William. It was a
      terrible half hour for Lumley, and when he left the box, amongst the
      averted faces of his friends, the sweat was pouring down his face. I can
      seem him now, as though it were yesterday. Then Lady Ruth followed. She
      was quietly dressed; the effect she produced was excellent. She told her
      story. She hinted at the insult. She spoke of the check. She had imagined
      no harm in accepting Wingrave&rsquo;s invitation to tea. Men and women of the
      hunt, who were on friendly terms, treated one another as comrades. She
      spoke of the blow. She had seen it delivered, and so on. And all the time,
      I sat within a few feet of Wingrave, and I knew that in the black box
      before him were burning love letters from this woman, to the man whose
      code of honor would ever have protected her husband from disgrace; and I
      knew that I was listening to the thing which you, Aynesworth, and many of
      your fellow story writers, have so wisely and so ignorantly dilated upon&mdash;the
      vengeance of a woman denied. Only I heard the words themselves, cold,
      earnest words, fall one by one from her lips like a sentence of doom&mdash;and
      there was life in the thing, life and death! When she had finished, the
      whole court was in a state of tension. Everyone was leaning forward. It
      would be the most piquant, the most wonderful cross examination every
      heard&mdash;the woman lying to save her honor and to achieve her
      vengeance; the man on trial for his life. Wingrave stood up. Lady Ruth
      raised her veil, and looked at him from the witness box. There was the
      most intense silence I ever realized. Who could tell the things which
      flashed from one to the other across the dark well of the court; who could
      measure the fierce, silent scorn which seemed to blaze from his eyes, as
      he held her there&mdash;his slave until he chose to give the signal for
      release? At last he looked away towards the judge, and the woman fell
      forward in the box gasping, a crumpled up, nerveless heap of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have no questions to ask this witness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone staggered. Wingrave&rsquo;s few friends were horrified. After that
      there was, of course, no hope for him. He got fifteen years&rsquo; penal
      servitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like an echo from that pent-up murmur of feeling which had rippled through
      the crowded court many years ago, his little group of auditors almost
      gasped as Lovell left his place and strolled down the room. Aynesworth
      laid his hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you were looking at that calendar! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell once more faced them. He was standing with his back to a round
      table, strewn with papers and magazines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the date,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the fact that I must leave England within
      a few hours, which forced this story from me. Tomorrow Wingrave will be
      free! Listen, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he continued, turning towards him, &ldquo;and the
      rest of you who fancy that it is I who am leaving a humdrum city for the
      world of tragedies! I leave you the legacy of a greater one than all Asia
      will yield to me! Lady Ruth is married to Lumley, and they hold today in
      London a very distinguished social position. Tomorrow Wingrave takes a
      hand in the game. He was once my friend; I was in court when he was tried;
      I was intimately acquainted with the lawyer&rsquo;s clerk who had the
      arrangement of his papers. I know what no one else breathing knows. He is
      a man who never forgives; a man who was brutally deceived, and who for
      years has had no other occupation than to brood upon his wrongs. He is
      very wealthy indeed, still young, he has marvelous tenacity of purpose,
      and he has brains. Tomorrow he will be free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth drew a little breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;if anything will happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the cruder passions may rage, and life and death
      be reckoned things of little account. But you who remain&mdash;who can
      tell?&mdash;you may look into the face of mightier things.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      OUTSIDE THE PALE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three men were together in a large and handsomely furnished sitting room
      of the Clarence Hotel, in Piccadilly. One, pale, quiet, and unobtrusive,
      dressed in sober black, the typical lawyer&rsquo;s clerk, was busy gathering up
      a collection of papers and documents from the table, over which they had
      been strewn. His employer, who had more the appearance of a country
      gentleman than the junior partner in the well-known firm of Rocke and Son,
      solicitors, had risen to his feet, and was drawing on his gloves. At the
      head of the table was the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, Sir Wingrave, that you are satisfied with this account of our
      stewardship,&rdquo; the solicitor said, as his clerk left the room. &ldquo;We have
      felt it a great responsibility at times, but everything seems to have
      turned out very well. The investments, of course, are all above
      suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly satisfied, I thank you,&rdquo; was the quiet reply. &ldquo;You seem to have
      studied my interests in a very satisfactory manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rocke had other things to say, but his client&rsquo;s manner seemed designed
      to create a barrier of formality between them. He hesitated, unwilling to
      leave, yet finding it exceedingly difficult to say the things which were
      in his mind. He temporized by referring back to matters already discussed,
      solely for the purpose of prolonging the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have quite made up your mind, then, to put the Tredowen property on
      the market,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You will excuse my reminding you of the fact
      that you have large accumulated funds in hand, and nearly a hundred
      thousand pounds worth of easily realizable securities. Tredowen has been
      in your mother&rsquo;s family for a good many years, and I should doubt whether
      it will be easily disposed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man at the head of the table raised his head. He looked steadily at
      the lawyer, who began to wish that he had left the room with his clerk.
      Decidedly, Sir Wingrave Seton was not an easy man to get on with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind is quite made up, thank you, on this and all other matters
      concerning which I have given you instructions,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;I
      have had plenty of time for consideration,&rdquo; he added drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer had his opening at last, and he plunged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we were at college together, and our connection
      is an old one. You must forgive me if I say how glad I am to see you here,
      and to know that your bad time is over. I can assure you that you have had
      my deepest sympathy. Nothing ever upset me so much as that unfortunate
      affair. I sincerely trust that you will do your best now to make up for
      lost time. You are still young, and you are rich. Let us leave business
      alone now, for the moment. What can I do for you as a friend, if you will
      allow me to call you so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave turned slightly in his chair. In his altered position, a ray of
      sunshine fell for the first time upon his gaunt but striking face. Lined
      and hardened, as though by exposure and want of personal care, there was
      also a lack of sensibility, an almost animal callousness, on the coldly
      lit eyes and unflinching mouth, which readily suggested some terrible and
      recent experience&mdash;something potent enough to have dried up the human
      nature out of the man and left him soulless. His clothes had the impress
      of the ready-made, although he wore them with a distinction which was
      obviously inherent; and notwithstanding the fact that he seemed to have
      been writing, he wore gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you, Rocke,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me repeat your question.
      What is there that you can do for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rocke was apparently a little nonplussed. The absolute
      imperturbability of the man who had once been his friend was
      disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the governor sent me instead of coming himself, because
      he thought that I might be more useful to you. London changes so quickly&mdash;you
      would hardly know your way about now. I should like you to come and dine
      with me tonight, and I&rsquo;ll take you round anywhere you care to go; and then
      if you don&rsquo;t want to go back to your old tradespeople, I could take you to
      my tailor and bookmaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; Wingrave asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocke was again taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There must be many ways in which I could be
      useful to you, but I can&rsquo;t think of them all at once. I am here to serve
      you professionally or as a friend, to the best of my ability. Can you
      suggest anything yourself? What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the question,&rdquo; Wingrave said, &ldquo;which I have been asking myself.
      Unfortunately, up to now, I have not been able to answer it. Regarding
      myself, however, from the point of view of a third party, I should say
      that the thing I was most in need of was the society of my fellow
      creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Rocke declared. &ldquo;That is what I thought you would say! It won&rsquo;t
      take us long to arrange something of the sort for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you put me up,&rdquo; Wingrave asked, &ldquo;at your club, and introduce me to
      your friends there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocke flinched before the steady gaze of those cold enquiring eyes, in
      which he fancied, too, that a gleam of malice shone. The color mounted to
      his cheeks. It was a most embarrassing situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can introduce you to some decent fellows, of course, and to some very
      charming ladies,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly, &ldquo;but as to the club&mdash;I&mdash;well,
      don&rsquo;t you think yourself that it would scarcely be wise to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Wingrave interrupted. &ldquo;And these ladies that you spoke of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! There&rsquo;s no difficulty about that,&rdquo; Rocke declared with an air of
      relief. &ldquo;I can make up a little dinner party for tonight, if you like.
      There&rsquo;s an awfully smart American woman over here, with the Fanciful Fan
      Company&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d like her, and she&rsquo;d come like a shot. Then
      I&rsquo;d get Daisy Vane&mdash;she&rsquo;s all right. They don&rsquo;t know anything, and
      wouldn&rsquo;t care if they did. Besides, you could call yourself what you
      liked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;I am afraid I did not make myself quite
      clear. I was not thinking of play fellows. I was thinking of the men and
      women of my own order. Shall I put the matter quite clearly? Can I take my
      place in society under my own name, renew my old friendships and build up
      new ones? Can I do this even at the risk of a few difficulties at first? I
      am not a sensitive man. I am prepared for the usual number of disagreeable
      incidents. But can I win my way through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his back against the wall, Rocke displayed more courage. Besides,
      what was the use of mincing matters with a man who had all the appearance
      of a human automaton, who never flinched or changed color, and whose
      passions seemed dried up and withered things?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid not, Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should not recommend you to
      try, at any rate for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your reasons,&rdquo; was the cool response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so with pleasure,&rdquo; Rocke answered. &ldquo;About the time of the trial
      and immediately afterwards, there was a certain amount of sympathy for
      you. People felt that you must have received a good deal of provocation,
      and there were several unexplained incidents which told in your favor.
      Today, I should think that the feeling amongst those who remember the
      affair at all is rather the other way. You heard, I believe, that Lady
      Ruth married Lumley Barrington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barrington has been very successful at the Bar, and they say that he is
      certain of a judgeship before long. His wife has backed him up well, they
      have entertained lavishly, and today I should think that she is one of the
      most popular hostesses in London. In her earlier days, I used to hear that
      she was one of the very fast hunting set&mdash;that was the time when you
      knew her. I can assure you that if ever that was true, she is a completely
      altered woman today. She is patroness of half a dozen great charitable
      schemes, she writes very clever articles in the Reviews on the Betterment
      of the Poor Question, and royalty itself visits at her house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Wingrave said drily. &ldquo;I was not aware of these changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever,&rdquo; Mr. Rocke continued, &ldquo;people were inclined to look a little
      askance at her, that has all gone by. Today she is one of the last women
      in the world of whom people would be likely to believe ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for this information. You seem
      to have come here today, Mr. Rocke, with good intentions towards me. Let
      me ask you to put yourself in my place. I am barely forty years old, and I
      am rich. I want to make the most of my life&mdash;under the somewhat
      peculiar circumstances. How and where should you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends a little upon your tastes, of course,&rdquo; Rocke answered. &ldquo;You
      are a sportsman, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fond of sport,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;At least I was. At present I am
      not conscious of having any positive tastes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Rocke continued, &ldquo;that I should first of all change my name.
      Then, without making any effort to come into touch with your old friends,
      I should seek acquaintance amongst the Bohemian world of London and Paris.
      There I might myself, perhaps, be able to help you. For sport, you might
      fish in Norway or Iceland, or shoot in Hungary; you could run to a yacht
      if you cared about it, and if you fancy big game, why, there&rsquo;s all Africa
      before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave listened, without changing a muscle of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your programme,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;presupposes that I have no ambitions
      beyond the pursuit of pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocke shrugged his shoulders. He was becoming more at his ease. He felt
      that his advice was sound, that he was showing a most comprehensive grasp
      of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that none of what we call the careers are open to
      you. You could not enter Parliament, and you are too old for the
      professions. The services, of course, are impossible. You might write, if
      your tastes ran that way. Nowadays, it seems to be the fashion to record
      one&rsquo;s experiences in print, if&mdash;if they should happen to be in any
      way exceptional. I can think of nothing else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;Your suggestions are
      eminently practical. I will think them over. Don&rsquo;t let me keep you any
      longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this evening,&rdquo; Rocke remarked. &ldquo;Shall I fix up that little dinner
      party? You have only to say the word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, but I think not,&rdquo; answered Wingrave. &ldquo;I
      will dine with you alone some evening, with pleasure! Not just as
      present!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocke looked, as he felt, puzzled. He honestly wished to be of service to
      this man, but he was at a loss to know what further suggestion he could
      make. There was something impenetrable about his client, something which
      he could not arrive at, behind the hard, grim face and measured words. He
      could not even guess as to what the man&rsquo;s hopes or intentions were.
      Eventually, although with some reluctance, he took up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if there is really nothing I can do for
      you, I will go. If you should change your mind, you have only to
      telephone. You can command me at any time. I am only anxious to be of
      service to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already been of service to me,&rdquo; Wingrave answered quietly. &ldquo;You
      have spoken the truth! You have helped me to realize my position more
      exactly. Will you give your father my compliments and thanks, and say that
      I am entirely satisfied with the firm&rsquo;s conduct of affairs during my&mdash;absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocke nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That will please the governor! I must be off now. I
      hope you&rsquo;ll soon be feeling quite yourself again, Sir Wingrave! It must
      seem a bit odd at first, I suppose, but it will wear off all right. What
      you want, after all, is society. Much better let me arrange that little
      dinner for tonight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later on, perhaps,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      A STUDENT OF CHARACTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Left alone, Wingrave walked for several minutes up and down the room, his
      hands behind him, his head bent. He walked, not restlessly, but with
      measured footsteps. His mind was fixed steadfastly upon the one immediate
      problem of his own future. His interview with Rocke had unsettled&mdash;to
      a certain extent unnerved&mdash;him. Was this freedom for which he had
      longed so passionately, this return into civilized life, to mean simply
      the exchange of an iron-barred cell for a palace whose outer gates were as
      hopelessly locked, even though the key was of gold! Freedom! Was it after
      all an illusion? Was his to be the hog&rsquo;s paradise of empty delights; were
      the other worlds indeed forbidden? He moved abruptly to the window and
      threw it open. Below was Piccadilly, brilliant with May sunshine, surging
      with life. Motors and carriages, omnibuses and hansoms, were all jostled
      together in a block; the pavements were thronged with a motley and
      ever-hurrying crowd. It seemed to him, accustomed to the callous and
      hopeless appearance of a less happy tribe, that the faces of these people
      were all aflame with the joy of the springtime. The perfume from the great
      clusters of yellow daffodils and violets floated up from the flower
      sellers&rsquo; baskets below; the fresh, warm air seemed to bring him poignant
      memories of crocus-starred lawns, of trim beds of hyacinths, of the song
      of birds, of the perfume of drooping lilac. Grim and motionless, as a
      figure of fate, Wingrave looked down from his window, with cold, yet
      discerning eyes. He was still an alien, a denizen in another world from
      that which flowed so smoothly and pleasantly below. It was something to
      which he did not belong, which he doubted, indeed, if ever again he could
      enter. He had no part in it, no share in that vigorous life, whose
      throbbings he could dimly feel, though his own heart was beating to a
      slower and a very different tune. They were his fellows in name only.
      Between him and them stood the judgment of&mdash;Rocke!
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil chances of the world are many! It was whilst his thoughts
      traveled in this fashion that the electric landaulette of Lady Ruth
      Barrington glided round the corner from St. James&rsquo; Street, and joined in
      the throng of vehicles slowly making their way down Piccadilly. His
      attention was attracted first by the white and spotless liveries of the
      servants&mdash;the form of locomotion itself was almost new to him. Then
      he saw the woman who leaned back amongst the cushions. She was elegantly
      dressed; she wore no veil; she did not look a day more than thirty. She
      was attractive, from the tips of her patent shoes, to the white bow which
      floated on the top of her lace parasol; a perfectly dressed, perfectly
      turned out woman. She had, too, the lazy confident air of a woman sure of
      herself and her friends. She knew nothing of the look which flashed down
      upon her from the window overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave turned away with a little gasp; a half-stifled exclamation had
      crept out from between his teeth. His cheeks seemed paler than ever, and
      his eyes unnaturally bright. Nevertheless, he was completely master of
      himself. On the table was a large deed box of papers, which Rocke had left
      for his inspection. From its recesses he drew out a smaller box, unlocked
      it with a key from his chain, and emptied its sole contents&mdash;a small
      packet of letters&mdash;upon the table. He counted them one by one. They
      were all there&mdash;and on top a photograph. A breath of half-forgotten
      perfume stole out into the room. He opened one of the letters, and its few
      passionate words came back to his memory, linked with a hundred other
      recollections, the desire of her eyes, of her lips raised for his, the
      caressing touch of her fingers. He found himself wondering, in an
      impersonal sort of way, that these things should so little affect him. His
      blood ran no less coldly, nor did his pulses beat the faster, for this
      backward glance into things finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door. He raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slim, fair young man obeyed the summons, and advanced into the room.
      Wingrave eyed him with immovable face. Nevertheless, his manner somehow
      suggested a displeased surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave Seton, I believe?&rdquo; the intruder said cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name,&rdquo; Wingrave admitted; &ldquo;but my orders below have evidently
      been disobeyed. I am not disposed to receive visitors today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intruder was not in the least abashed. He laid his hat upon the table,
      and felt in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They did try to keep me out, but I told them
      that my business was urgent. I have been a journalist, you see, and am
      used to these little maneuvers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked at him steadily, with close-drawn eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;that you are in here in your journalistic
      capacity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I should be guilty of such an
      impertinence. My name is Aynesworth. Walter Aynesworth. I have a letter
      for you from Lovell. You remember him, I daresay. Here it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced it from his breast coat pocket, and handed it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Lovell?&rdquo; Wingrave asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left for the East early this morning,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;He had to
      go almost at an hour&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave broke the seal, and read the letter through. Afterwards he tore
      it into small pieces and threw them into the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with me, Mr. Aynesworth?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be your secretary,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My secretary,&rdquo; Wingrave repeated. &ldquo;I am much obliged to you, but I am not
      requiring anyone in that capacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;but I think you are. You may not have
      realized it yet, but if you will consider the matter carefully, I think
      you will agree with me that a secretary, or companion of some sort, is
      exactly what you do need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of curiosity,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;I should be glad to know why you
      think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;In the first place, I know the story of
      your life, and the unfortunate incident which has kept you out of society
      for the last ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Lovell, I presume,&rdquo; Wingrave interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Aynesworth admitted. &ldquo;Ten years&rsquo; absence from English life
      today means that you return to it an absolute and complete stranger. You
      would be like a Cook&rsquo;s tourist abroad, without a guide or a Baedeker, if
      you attempted to rely upon yourself. Now I am rather a Bohemian sort of
      person, but I have just the sort of all-round knowledge which would be
      most useful to you. I have gone a little way into society, and I know
      something about politics. I can bring you up-to-date on both these
      matters. I know where to dine well in town, and where to be amused. I can
      tell you where to get your clothes, and the best place for all the
      etceteras. If you want to travel, I can speak French and German; and I
      consider myself a bit of a sportsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; Wingrave answered, &ldquo;I congratulate you upon your versatility.
      I am quite convinced! I shall advertise at once for a secretary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why advertise?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked. &ldquo;I am here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not suit me at all,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked. &ldquo;I forget whether I mentioned all my
      accomplishments. I am an Oxford man with a degree, and I can write
      tolerable English. I&rsquo;ve a fair head for figures, and I don&rsquo;t require too
      large a salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Wingrave answered drily. &ldquo;You are altogether too desirable? I
      should not require an Admirable Crichton for my purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth remained unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know best, of course! Suppose you tell me what
      sort of a man would satisfy you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; Wingrave asked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would amuse me,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve come a mile or so out
      of my way, and given up a whole morning to come and see you. Go on! It
      won&rsquo;t take long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not remind you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you came on your own initiative. I
      owe you the idea, however, so I will tell you the sort of person I shall
      look out for. In the first place, I do not require him to be a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be a shocking bounder at times,&rdquo; Aynesworth murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be more a sort of an upper servant,&rdquo; Wingrave continued. &ldquo;I
      should require him to obey me implicitly, whatever I told him to do. You
      have a conscience, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I have been a journalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the remnants of one, at all events,&rdquo; Wingrave said, &ldquo;quite
      sufficient, no doubt, to interfere with your possible usefulness to me. I
      must have someone who is poor&mdash;too poor to question my will, or to
      dispute my orders, whatever they might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never,&rdquo; Aynesworth declared, &ldquo;possessed a superfluous half-crown
      in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably possess what is called a sense of honor,&rdquo; Wingrave
      continued. &ldquo;You would certainly disapprove of some of my proceedings, and
      you would probably disobey my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sense of honor!&rdquo; Aynesworth repeated. &ldquo;You have too flattering an opinion
      of me. I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I always cheat at cards if I get the
      chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t suit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I come?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stay now,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;Your salary will be four hundred a
      year. You will live at my expense. The day you disobey an order of mine,
      you go! No notice, mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;What should I do first? Send you a tailor,
      I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give the afternoon to that sort of people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here is a
      list of the tradesmen I used to deal with. Kindly avoid them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth glanced at the slip of paper, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All out-of-date now,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back to lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      A DELICATE MISSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aynesworth was back in less than an hour. He carried under his arm a brown
      paper parcel, the strings of which he commenced at once to untie.
      Wingrave, who had been engrossed in the contents of his deed box, watched
      him with immovable face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tailor will be here at two-thirty,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;and the other
      fellows will follow on at half an hour&rsquo;s interval. The manicurist and the
      barber are coming at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you there?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cigars and cigarettes, and jolly good ones, too,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered,
      opening a flat tin box, and smelling the contents appreciatively. &ldquo;Try one
      of these! The finest Turkish tobacco grown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smoke,&rdquo; Wingrave answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You&rsquo;ve got out of it, but you must pick it up again,&rdquo; Aynesworth
      declared. &ldquo;Best thing out for the nerves&mdash;sort of humanizes one, you
      know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humanizes one, does it?&rdquo; Wingrave remarked softly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a cigarette from the box, curtly inviting Aynesworth to do the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about lunch?&rdquo; the latter asked. &ldquo;Would you care to come round with
      me to the Cannibal Club? Rather a Bohemian set, but there are always some
      good fellows there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;If you will ask me again in a few
      days&rsquo; time, I shall be very pleased. I do not wish to leave the hotel just
      at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I should be glad if you
      would leave me now, and return at that hour. In the meantime, I have a
      commission for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Aynesworth declared. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go,&rdquo; Wingrave directed, &ldquo;to No. 13, Cadogan Street, and you will
      enquire for Lady Ruth Barrington. If she should be out, ascertain the time
      of her return, and wait for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is out of town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in London,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I have seen her from the window
      this morning. You will give her a message. Say that you come from me, and
      that I desire to see her tomorrow. The time and place she can fix, but I
      should prefer not to go to her house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth stooped down to relight his cigarette. He felt that Wingrave
      was watching him, and he wished to keep his face hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unknown to Lady Ruth,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Supposing she should refuse to
      see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked at him coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you what I wish done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The task does not seem to be
      a difficult one. Please see to it that I have an answer by five o&rsquo;clock&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth lunched with a few of his particular friends at the club. They
      heard of his new adventure with somewhat doubtful approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never stand the routine, old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about your own work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will the Daily Scribbler people say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine it will last very long,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I shall get a
      fair amount of time to myself. The work I do on the Daily Scribbler
      doesn&rsquo;t amount to anything. It was a chance I simply couldn&rsquo;t refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor of a well-known London paper leaned back in his chair, and
      pinched a cigar carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably find the whole thing a sell,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;The story, as
      Lovell told it, sounded dramatic enough, and if the man were to come back
      to life again, fresh and vigorous, things might happen, provided, of
      course, that Lovell was right in his suppositions. But ten or twelve
      years&rsquo; solitary confinement, although it mayn&rsquo;t sound much on paper, is
      enough to crush all the life and energy out of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like, Walter?&rdquo; another man asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t describe him,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to try.
      I&rsquo;ll bring him here some day. You fellows shall see him for yourselves. I
      find him interesting enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole thing,&rdquo; the editor declared, &ldquo;will fizzle out. You see if it
      doesn&rsquo;t? A man who&rsquo;s just spent ten or twelve years in prison isn&rsquo;t likely
      to run any risk of going there again. There will be no tragedy; more
      likely reconciliation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Aynesworth said imperturbably. &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t only the
      possibility of anything of that sort happening, you know, which attracted
      me. It was the tragedy of the man himself, with his numbed, helpless life,
      set down here in the midst of us, with a great, blank chasm between him
      and his past. What is there left to drive the wheels? The events of one
      day are simple and monotonous enough to us, because they lean up against
      the events of yesterday, and the yesterdays before! How do they seem, I
      wonder, to a man whose yesterday was more than a decade of years ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a grim sensation,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but I am afraid with you, my
      dear Walter, it is an affair of shop. You wish to cull from your
      interesting employer the material for that every-becoming novel of yours.
      Let&rsquo;s go upstairs! I&rsquo;ve time for one pool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a commission to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the club and walked westwards, humming softly to himself, but
      thinking all the time intently. His errand disturbed him. He was to be the
      means of bringing together again these two people who had played the
      principal parts in Lovell&rsquo;s drama&mdash;his new employer and the woman who
      had ruined his life. What was the object of it? What manner of vengeance
      did he mean to deal out to her? Lovell&rsquo;s words of premonition returned to
      him just then with curious insistence&mdash;he was so certain that
      Wingrave&rsquo;s reappearance would lead to tragical happenings. Aynesworth
      himself never doubted it. His brief interview with the man into whose
      service he had almost forced himself had impressed him wonderfully. Yet,
      what weapon was there, save the crude one of physical force, with which
      Wingrave could strike?
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell at No. 13, Cadogan Street, and sent in his card by the
      footman. The man accepted it doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship has only just got up from luncheon, sir, and she is not
      receiving this afternoon,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth took back his card, and scribbled upon it the name of the
      newspaper for which he still occasionally worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship will perhaps see me,&rdquo; he said, handing the card back to the
      man. &ldquo;It is a matter of business. I will not detain her for more than a
      few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man returned presently, and ushered him into a small sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship will be quite half an hour before she can see you, sir,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, taking up a paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time passed slowly. At last, the door was opened. A woman, in a plain
      but exquisitely fitting black gown, entered. From Lovell&rsquo;s description,
      Aynesworth recognized her at once, and yet, for a moment, he hesitated to
      believe that this was the woman whom he had come to see. The years had
      indeed left her untouched. Her figure was slight, almost girlish; her
      complexion as smooth, and her coloring, faint though it was, as delicate
      and natural as a child&rsquo;s. Her eyes were unusually large, and the lashes
      which shielded them heavy. It was when she looked at him that Aynesworth
      began to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried his card in her hand, and glanced at it as he bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the Daily Scribbler,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You want me to tell you about my
      bazaar, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am attached to the Daily Scribbler, Lady Ruth Barrington,&rdquo; Aynesworth
      answered; &ldquo;but my business this afternoon has nothing to do with the
      paper. I have called with a message from&mdash;an old friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows ever so slightly. The graciousness of her manner
      was perceptibly abated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! I scarcely understand you, Mr.&mdash;Aynesworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My message,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, &ldquo;is from Sir Wingrave Seton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The look of enquiry, half impatient, half interrogative, faded slowly from
      her face. She stood quite still; her impassive features seemed like a
      plaster cast, from which all life and feeling were drawn out. Her eyes
      began slowly to dilate, and she shivered as though with cold. Then the man
      who was watching her and wondering, knew that this was fear&mdash;fear
      undiluted and naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped forward, and placed a chair for her. She felt for the back of
      it with trembling fingers and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;Sir Wingrave Seton&mdash;out of prison?&rdquo; she asked in a strange,
      dry tone. One would have thought that she had been choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since yesterday,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his time&mdash;is not up yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always a reduction,&rdquo; Aynesworth reminded her, &ldquo;for what is
      called good conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for several moments. Then she raised her head. She was a
      brave woman, and she was rapidly recovering her self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what does he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see you,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;tomorrow afternoon, either here or at
      his apartments in the Clarence Hotel. He would prefer not to come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you his friend?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his secretary,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in his confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only entered his service this morning,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you know,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;of the unfortunate affair which
      led&mdash;to his imprisonment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told the whole story,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes rested thoughtfully upon his. It seemed as though she were trying
      to read in his face exactly what he meant by &ldquo;the whole story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you think that anything but pain and unpleasantness
      can come of a meeting between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;it is not for me to form an opinion. I
      am Sir Wingrave Seton&rsquo;s secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he going to do?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he going abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of his plans,&rdquo; Aynesworth declared. &ldquo;What answer shall I
      take back to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him earnestly. Gradually her face was softening. The frozen
      look was passing away. The expression was coming back to her eyes. She
      leaned a little towards him. Her voice, although it was raised above a
      whisper, was full of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I am afraid of Sir Wingrave Seton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was always a little afraid of him,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;even in the days
      when we were friendly. He was so hard and unforgiving. I know he thinks
      that he has a grievance against me. He will have been brooding about it
      all these years. I dare not see him! I&mdash;I am terrified!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is your answer,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, &ldquo;I will convey it to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her beautiful eyes were full of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; she said, in a low tone, &ldquo;for a young man you are very
      unsympathetic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My position,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;does not allow me the luxury of
      considering my personal feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; she said, looking for a moment upon the floor; &ldquo;you have
      probably been prejudiced against me. You have heard only one story.
      Listen&rdquo;&mdash;she raised her eyes suddenly, and leaned a little forward in
      her chair&mdash;&ldquo;some day, if you will come and see me when I am alone and
      we have time to spare, I will tell you the whole truth. I will tell you
      exactly what happened! You shall judge for yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes filled slowly with tears. Aynesworth looked away. He was
      miserably uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot be quite so hard-hearted as you try to seem, Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo;
       she said quietly. &ldquo;I want to ask you a question. You must answer it? You
      don&rsquo;t know how much it means to me. You are Sir Wingrave Seton&rsquo;s
      secretary; you have access to all his papers. Have you seen any letters of
      mine? Do you know if he still has any in his possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My answer to both questions is &lsquo;No!&rsquo;&rdquo; Aynesworth said a little stiffly.
      &ldquo;I only entered the service of Sir Wingrave Seton this morning, and I know
      nothing at all, as yet, of his private affairs. And, Lady Ruth, you must
      forgive my reminding you that, in any case, I could not discuss such
      matters with you,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with a faint, strange smile. Afterwards, when he tried
      to do so, Aynesworth found it impossible to describe the expression which
      flitted across her face. He only knew that it left him with the impression
      of having received a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incorruptible!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Sir Wingrave Seton is indeed a fortunate
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a lingering sweetness in her tone which still had a note of
      mockery in it. Her silence left Aynesworth conscious of a vague sense of
      uneasiness. He felt that her eyes were raised to his, and for some reason,
      which he could not translate even into a definite thought, he wished to
      avoid them. The silence was prolonged. For long afterwards he remembered
      those few minutes. There was a sort of volcanic intensity in the
      atmosphere. He was acutely conscious of small extraneous things, of the
      perfume of a great bowl of hyacinths, the ticking of a tiny French clock,
      the restless drumming of her finger tips upon the arm of her chair. All
      the time he seemed actually to feel her eyes, commanding, impelling,
      beseeching him to turn round. He did so at last, and looked her full in
      the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you favor me with an answer to my message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she answered, smiling quite naturally. &ldquo;I will come and see
      Sir Wingrave Seton at four o&rsquo;clock tomorrow afternoon. You can tell him
      that I think it rather an extraordinary request, but under the
      circumstances I will do as he suggests. He is staying at the Clarence, I
      presume, under his own name? I shall have no difficulty in finding him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is staying there under his own name,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;and I will
      see that you have no difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So kind of you,&rdquo; she murmured, holding out her hand. And again there was
      something mysterious in her eyes as she raised them to him, as though
      there existed between them already some understanding which mocked the
      conventionality of her words. Aynesworth left the house, and lit a
      cigarette upon the pavement outside with a little sigh of relief. He felt
      somehow humiliated. Did she fancy, he wondered, that he was a callow boy
      to dance to any tune of her piping&mdash;that he had never before seen a
      beautiful woman who wanted her own way?

    <h2>
      THE GOSPEL OF HATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; Wingrave asked his secretary as they sat at dinner that night,
      &ldquo;did you think of Lady Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In plain words, I should not like to tell you,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I
      only hope that you will not send me to see her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered deliberately, &ldquo;is a very beautiful woman,
      with all the most dangerous gifts of Eve when she wanted her own way. She
      did me the scanty honor of appraising me as an easy victim, and she asked
      questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wanted me to tell her if you still had in your possession certain
      letters of hers,&rdquo; Aynesworth said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her, of course,&rdquo; Aynesworth continued, &ldquo;that having been in your
      service for a few hours only, I was scarcely in a position to know. I
      ventured further to remind her that such questions, addressed from her to
      me, were, to say the least of it, improper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave&rsquo;s lips parted in what should have been a smile, but the spirit of
      mirth was lacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing else,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;She simply dismissed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;your grievance. You are annoyed because
      she regarded you as too easy a victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Aynesworth admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was some excuse for her, after all,&rdquo; Wingrave continued coolly.
      &ldquo;She possesses powers which you yourself have already admitted, and you, I
      should say, are a fairly impressionable person, so far as her sex is
      concerned. Confess now, that she did not leave you altogether
      indifferent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Aynesworth admitted reluctantly. He did not care to say
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In case you should feel any curiosity on the subject,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked,
      &ldquo;I may tell you that I have those letters which she was so anxious to know
      about, and I shall keep them safe&mdash;even from you! You can amuse
      yourself with her if you like. You will never be able to tell her more
      than I care for her to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth continued his dinner in silence. After all, he was beginning to
      fear that he had made a mistake. Lovell had somehow contrived to impart a
      subtly tragic note to his story, but the outcome of it all seemed to
      assume a more sordid aspect. These two would meet, there would be
      recriminations, a tragic appeal for forgiveness, possibly some
      melodramatic attempt at vengeance. The glamour of the affair seemed to him
      to be fading away, now that he had come into actual contact with it. It
      was not until he began to study his companion during a somewhat prolonged
      silence that he felt the reaction. It was then that he began to see new
      things, that he felt the enthusiasm kindled by Lovell&rsquo;s strangely told
      story begin to revive. It was not the watching for events more or less
      commonplace which would repay him for the step he had taken; it was the
      study of this man, placed in so strange a position,&mdash;a man come back
      to life, after years of absolute isolation. He had broken away from the
      chain which links together men of similar tastes and occupations, and
      which goes to the creation of type. He was in a unique position! He was in
      the world, but not of it. He was groping about amongst familiar scenes,
      over which time had thrown the pall of unfamiliarity. What manner of place
      would he find&mdash;what manner of place did he desire to find? It was
      here that the real interest of the situation culminated. At least, so
      Aynesworth thought then.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were dining at a restaurant in the Strand, which Aynesworth had
      selected as representing one, the more wealthy, type of Bohemian life. The
      dinner and wine had been of his choosing. Wingrave had stipulated only for
      the best. Wingrave himself had eaten very little, the bottle of wine stood
      half empty between them. The atmosphere of the place, the effect of the
      wine, the delicate food, and the music, were visible to a greater or less
      degree, according to temperament, amongst all the other little groups of
      men and women by whom they were surrounded. Wingrave alone remained
      unaffected. He was carefully and correctly dressed in clothes borrowed
      from his new tailor, and he showed not the slightest signs of strangeness
      or gaucherie amongst his unfamiliar surroundings. He looked about him
      always, with the cold, easy nonchalance of the man of the world. Of being
      recognized he had not the slightest fear. His frame and bearing, and the
      brightness of his deep, strong eyes, still belonged to early middle age,
      but his face itself, worn and hardened, was the face of an elderly man.
      The more Aynesworth watched him, the more puzzled he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that you are disappointed in this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;It is typical of a class, I suppose. It
      is the sort of place I wished to visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a corner of the room Aynesworth had recognized a friend and fellow
      clubman, who was acting at a neighboring theater. He was dining with some
      young ladies of his company, and beckoned to Aynesworth to come over and
      join them. He pointed them out to Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you care to be introduced?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Holiwell is a very good
      fellow, and the girls might interest you. Two of them are Americans, and
      they are very popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should be glad to meet your friend some time
      when he is alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first intimation which Aynesworth had received of his
      companion&rsquo;s sentiments as regards the other sex. Years afterwards, when
      his attitude towards them was often quoted as being one of the
      extraordinary features of an extraordinary personality, he remembered his
      perseverance on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not spoken to a woman for so many years,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;Why not
      renew the experience? Nothing so humanizing, you know&mdash;not even
      cigarettes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave&rsquo;s face fell, if possible into sterner lines. His tone was cold
      and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My scheme of life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may be reconstructed more than once before
      I am satisfied. But I can assure you of this! There will be no serious
      place in it for women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders. He never doubted but that in a month of
      two his vis-a-vis would talk differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your scheme of life,&rdquo; he repeated thoughtfully. &ldquo;That sounds interesting!
      Have you any objection, I wonder, to telling me what manner of life you
      propose to lead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was several moments before Wingrave answered him. He was smoking a
      cigar in a mechanical sort of way, but he obviously derived no pleasure
      from it. Yet Aynesworth noticed that some instinct had led him to choose
      the finest brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, letting his eyes rest coldly upon his questioner, &ldquo;if
      I told you all that was in my mind you would waive your month&rsquo;s salary and
      get back to your journalism!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you suppose that?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I am not a moralist myself, nor
      am I the keeper of your conscience. I don&rsquo;t think that you could frighten
      me off just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; Wingrave admitted, &ldquo;there are times when I fear that we
      shall not get on together. I begin to suspect that you have a conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the first,&rdquo; Aynesworth assured him, &ldquo;who has ever flattered me to
      that extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be elastic, of course,&rdquo; Wingrave continued, &ldquo;but I suspect its
      existence. I warn you that association with me will try it hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the challenge,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rasher than you imagine,&rdquo; Wingrave declared. &ldquo;For instance, I
      have admitted to you, have I not, that I am interested in my fellow
      creatures, that I want to mix with them and watch them at their daily
      lives. Let me assure you that that interest is not a benevolent one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never fancied that you were a budding philanthropist,&rdquo; Aynesworth
      remarked, lighting a fresh cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find myself,&rdquo; Wingrave continued thoughtfully, &ldquo;in a somewhat unique
      position. I am one of the ordinary human beings with whom the world is
      peopled, but I am not conscious of any of the usual weaknesses of
      sentiment or morality. For instance, if that gentleman with the red face,
      who has obviously eaten and drunk too much, were to have an apoplectic fit
      at the moment, and die in his chair, it would not shock or distress me in
      the least. On the contrary, I should be disposed to welcome his removal
      from a world which he obviously does nothing to adorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth glanced at the person in question. He was a theatrical agent
      and financier of stock companies, whom he knew very well by sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Wingrave continued, &ldquo;that I was born with the usual moral
      sentiments, and the usual feelings of kinship towards my fellow creatures.
      Circumstances, however, have wholly destroyed them. To me, men have become
      the puppets and women the dancing dolls of life. My interest in them, if
      it exists at all, is malevolent. I should like to see them all suffer
      exactly as I have suffered. It would interest me exceedingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Aynesworth remained silent. He was anxious to hear all that was in
      the other&rsquo;s mind, and he feared lest any interruption might divert him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are men in the world,&rdquo; Wingrave continued, &ldquo;called philanthropists,
      amiable, obese creatures as a rule, whose professed aim in life it is to
      do as much good as possible. I take my stand upon the other pole. It is my
      desire to encourage and to work as much evil as possible. I wish to bring
      all the suffering I can upon those who come within the sphere of my
      influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are likely,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked, &ldquo;to achieve popularity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave regarded him steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your speech,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is flippant, but you yourself do not realize how
      near it comes to the truth. Human beings are like dogs&mdash;they are
      always ready to lick the hand that flogs them. I mean to use the scourge
      whenever I can seize the opportunity, but you will find the jackals at my
      heels, nevertheless, whenever I choose to whistle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth helped himself to a liqueur. He felt that he needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One weakness alone distresses me,&rdquo; Wingrave continued. &ldquo;In all ordinary
      matters of sentiment I am simply a negation. There is one antipathy,
      however, which I find it hard to overcome. The very sight of a woman, or
      the sound of her voice, distresses me. This is the more unfortunate,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;because it is upon the shoulders of her sex that the greater
      portion of my debt to my fellow creatures rests. However, time may help
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth leaned back in his chair, and contemplated his companion for
      the next few moments in thoughtful silence. It was hard, he felt, to take
      a man who talked like this seriously. His manner was convincing, his
      speech deliberate and assured. There was not the slightest doubt but that
      he meant what he said, yet it seemed to Aynesworth equally certain that
      the time would come, and come quickly, when the unnatural hardness of the
      man would yield to the genial influence of friendship, of pleasure, of the
      subtle joys of freedom. Those past days of hideous monotony, of
      profitless, debasing toil, the long, sleepless nights, the very nightmare
      of life to a man of Wingrave&rsquo;s culture and habits, might well have
      poisoned his soul, have filled him with ideas such as these. But
      everything was different now! The history of the world could show no epoch
      when pleasures so many and various were there for the man who carries the
      golden key. Today he was a looker-on, and the ice of his years of
      bitterness had not melted. Tomorrow, at any moment, he might catch a whiff
      of the fragrance of life, and the blood in his veins would move to a
      different tune. This was how it seemed to Aynesworth, as he studied his
      companion through the faint blue mist of tobacco smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This expression of your sentiments,&rdquo; he remarked at last, &ldquo;is interesting
      so far as it goes. I am, however, a practical person, and my connection
      with you is of a practical order. You don&rsquo;t propose, I presume, to
      promenade the streets with a cat-o-nine-tails?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your curiosity,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;is reasonable. Tomorrow I may
      gratify some portion of it after my interview with Lady Ruth. In the
      meantime, I might remark that to the observant person who has wits and
      money, the opportunities for doing evil present themselves, I think, with
      reasonable frequency. I do not propose, however, to leave things
      altogether to chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A definite scheme of ill-doing,&rdquo; Aynesworth ventured to suggest, &ldquo;would
      be more satisfactory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called for the bill, and his eyes wandered once more around the room as
      the waiter counted out the change. The band were playing the &ldquo;Valse
      Amoureuse&rdquo;; the air was grown heavy with the odor of tobacco and the
      mingled perfumes of flowers and scents. A refrain of soft laughter
      followed the music. An after-dinner air pervaded the place. Wingrave&rsquo;s lip
      curled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lack of kinship with my fellows,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;is exceedingly well
      defined just now. I agree with the one philosopher who declared that
      &lsquo;eating and drinking are functions which are better performed in
      private.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men went on to a theater. The play was a society trifle&mdash;a
      thing of the moment. Wingrave listened gravely, without a smile or any
      particular sign of interest. At the end of the second act, he turned
      towards his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady in the box opposite,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;desires to attract your
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth looked up and recognized Lady Ruth. She was fanning herself
      languidly, but her eyes were fixed upon the two men. She leaned a little
      forward, and her gesture was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth rose to his feet a little doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;Present my compliments and excuses. I
      feel that a meeting now would amount to an anti-climax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth made his way upstairs. Lady Ruth was alone, and he noticed that
      she had withdrawn to a chair where she was invisible to the house. Even
      Aynesworth himself could not see her face clearly at first, for she had
      chosen the darkest corner of the box. He gathered an impression of a
      gleaming white neck and bosom rising and falling rather more quickly than
      was natural, eyes which shone softly through the gloom, and the perfume of
      white roses, a great cluster of which lay upon the box ledge. Her voice
      was scarcely raised above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is&mdash;Sir Wingrave with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;It was he who saw you first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to catch her breath. Her voice was still tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is changed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I should not have recognized him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were the best ten years of his life,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;Think of
      how and in what surroundings he has been compelled to live. No wonder that
      he has had the humanity hammered out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shivered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he always like this?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I have watched him. He never smiles.
      He looks as hard as fate itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known him only a few hours,&rdquo; Aynesworth reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not come tomorrow,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;I am afraid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to tell him so?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You are very unfeeling, Mr. Aynesworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he answered, and looked away towards the orchestra. He did
      not wish to meet her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I have no one to whom I dare speak&mdash;of
      this. I dare not mention his name to my husband. It was my evidence which
      convicted him, and I can see, I know, that he is vindictive. And he has
      those letters! Oh! If I could only get them back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice trembled with an appeal whispered but passionate. It was
      wonderful how musical and yet how softly spoken her words were. They were
      like live things, and the few feet of darkened space through which they
      had passed seemed charged with magnetic influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Aynesworth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, Lady Ruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The electric bell rang softly from outside, and the orchestra commenced to
      play. Lady Ruth rose and looked at herself in the mirror. Then she turned
      and smiled at her visitor. The pallor of her face was no longer unnatural.
      She was a wonderful woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come tomorrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Shall I see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;depends upon Sir Wingrave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a little grimace as she dismissed him. Wingrave did not speak to
      his companion for some time after he had resumed his seat. Then he
      inclined his head towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come to terms with her ladyship?&rdquo; he asked drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can name your own price,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;She will pay! Don&rsquo;t be
      afraid of making her bid up. She has a good deal at stake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth made no reply. He was thinking how easy it would be to hate
      this man!

    <h2>
      &ldquo;HAST THOU FOUND ME, O MINE ENEMY?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Aynesworth was waiting in the hall on the following afternoon when Lady
      Ruth arrived. He had half expected that she would drive up to the side
      door in a hansom, would wear a thick veil, and adopt the other
      appurtenances of a clandestine meeting. But Lady Ruth was much too clever
      a woman for anything of the sort. She descended at the great front
      entrance from her own electric coupe, and swept into the hotel followed by
      her maid. She stopped to speak to the manager of the hotel, who knew her
      from her visits to the world-famous restaurant, and she asked at once for
      Sir Wingrave Seton. Then she saw Aynesworth, and crossed the hall with
      outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice of you to be here,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Can you take me to Sir
      Wingrave at once? I have such a busy afternoon that I was afraid at the
      last moment that I should be unable to come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth led her towards the lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave is in his sitting room,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It is only on the
      first floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She directed her maid where to wait, and followed him. On the way down the
      corridor, he stole a glance at her. She was a little pale, and he could
      see that she had nerved herself to this interview with a great effort. As
      he knocked at the door, her great eyes were raised for a moment to his,
      and they were like the eyes of a frightened child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time for more. They were in the room, and Wingrave had risen
      to meet them. Lady Ruth did not hesitate for a moment. She crossed the
      room towards him with outstretched hands. Aynesworth, who was standing a
      little on one side, watched their meeting with intense, though covert
      interest. She had pushed back her veil, her head was a little upraised in
      a mute gesture of appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pale to the lips, but her eyes were soft with hidden tears.
      Wingrave stood stonily silent, like a figure of fate. His hands remained
      by his sides. Her welcome found no response from him. She came to a
      standstill, and, swaying a little, stretched out her hand and steadied
      herself by grasping the back of a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave,&rdquo; she murmured, and her voice was full of musical reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth turned to leave the room, but Wingrave, looking over her head,
      addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remain here, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are some papers at
      that desk which require sorting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth hesitated. He had caught the look on Lady Ruth&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could excuse me for half an hour, Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot spare you at present,&rdquo; Wingrave interrupted. &ldquo;Kindly remain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth had no alternative but to obey. Wingrave handed a chair to Lady
      Ruth. He was looking at her steadfastly. There were no signs of any sort
      of emotion in his face. Whatever their relations in the past might have
      been, it was hard to believe, from his present demeanor, that he felt any.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;are you going to be unkind to me&mdash;you,
      whom I have always thought of in my dreams as the most generous of men! I
      have looked forward so much to seeing you again&mdash;to knowing that you
      were free! Don&rsquo;t disappoint me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave laughed shortly, and Aynesworth bent closer over his work, with a
      gathering frown upon his forehead. A mirthless laugh is never a pleasant
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappoint you!&rdquo; he repeated calmly. &ldquo;No! I must try and avoid that! You
      have been looking forward with so much joy to this meeting then? I am
      flattered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shivered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have looked forward to it,&rdquo; she answered, and her voice was dull and
      lifeless with pain. &ldquo;But you are not glad to see me,&rdquo; she continued.
      &ldquo;There is no welcome in your face! You are changed&mdash;altogether! Why
      did you send for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Wingrave was standing upon the hearthrug,
      cold, passionless, Sphinx-like. Lady Ruth was seated a few feet away, but
      her face was hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe me something!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owe&mdash;you something?&rdquo; she repeated vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you deny it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; she declared with emotion. &ldquo;Not for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to give you an opportunity of repaying some portion of
      that debt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his. Her whispered words came so softly that they
      were almost inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me what I can do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He commenced to speak at some length, very impassively, very deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will doubtless appreciate the fact,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my position,
      today, is a somewhat peculiar one. I have had enough of solitude. I am
      rich! I desire to mix once more on equal terms amongst my fellows. And
      against that, I have the misfortune to be a convicted felon, who has spent
      the last ten or a dozen years amongst the scum of the earth, engaged in
      degrading tasks, and with no identity save a number. The position, as you
      will doubtless observe, is a difficult one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell from his. Once more she shivered, as though with physical
      pain. Something that was like a smile, only that it was cold and lifeless,
      flitted across his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to live in foreign countries. On the
      contrary, I have plans which necessitate my living in England. The
      difficulties by this time are, without doubt, fully apparent to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing. Her eyes were once more watching his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My looking glass,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;shows me that I am changed beyond any
      reasonable chance of recognition. I do not believe that the Wingrave Seton
      of today would readily be recognized as the Wingrave Seton of twelve years
      ago. But I propose to make assurance doubly sure. I am leaving this
      country for several years, at once. I shall go to America, and I shall
      return as Mr. Wingrave, millionaire&mdash;and I propose, by the way, to
      make money there. I desire, under that identity, to take my place once
      more amongst my fellows. I shall bring letters of introduction&mdash;to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long and somewhat ominous silence! Lady Ruth&rsquo;s eyes were fixed
      upon the floor. She was thinking, and thinking rapidly, but there were no
      signs of it in her pale drawn face. At last she looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my husband,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He would recognize you, if no one else
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a clever woman,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I leave it to you to deal with
      your husband as seems best to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;would recognize you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me the favor,&rdquo; he begged her, &ldquo;to look at me carefully for several
      moments. You doubtless have some imperfect recollection of what I was.
      Compare it with my present appearance! I venture to think that you will
      agree with me. Recognition is barely possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was silence. Lady Ruth seemed to have no words, but there was
      the look of a frightened child upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that the idea does not appeal to you! I can
      understand that my presence may serve to recall a period which you and
      your husband would doubtless prefer to forget&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little staccato cry of pain; a cry which seemed to spring into life from
      a tortured heart, broke from her lips. Aynesworth heard it, and, at that
      moment, he hated his employer. Wingrave paused for a moment politely, and
      then continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can assure you that you will find very little
      in the Mr. Wingrave of New York to remind you of the past. I shall do my
      utmost to win for myself a place in your esteem, which will help you to
      forget the other relationship, which, if my memory serves me, used once to
      exist between us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head. Either she realized that, for the present, the man
      was immune against all sentiment, or his calm brutality had had a
      correspondingly hardening effect upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I agree,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you give me back my letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;upon you. I enter into no engagement. I make no
      promises. I simply remind you that it would be equally possible for me to
      take my place in the world as a rehabilitated Wingrave Seton. Ten years
      ago I yielded to sentiment. Today I have outlived it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten years ago,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;you were a hero. God knows what you are
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; he answered smoothly. &ldquo;I am free to admit that I am a puzzle to
      myself. I find myself, in fact, a most interesting study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consent,&rdquo; she said, with a little shudder. &ldquo;I am going now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a sensible woman,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Aynesworth, show Lady Ruth to
      her carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet. Hung from her neck by a chain of fine gold, was a
      large Chinchilla muff. She stood before him, and her hands had sought its
      shelter. Timidly she withdrew one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you shake hands with me, Wingrave?&rdquo; she asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I may better my manners in America, but a present
      I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed out of the room. Aynesworth followed, closing the door behind
      them. In the corridor she stumbled, and caught at his arm for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Take me where I can sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found her a quiet corner in the drawing room. She sat perfectly still
      for nearly five minutes, with her eyes closed. Then she opened them, and
      looked at her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you so poor that you must serve a man
      like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not poverty,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I knew his history, and I am interested
      in him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You write novels, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I try,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;His story fascinated me. He stands today in a
      unique position to life. I want to see how he will come out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew his story&mdash;the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I heard it from a journalist who was in court,
      his only friend, the only man who knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his way to Japan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a little breath between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were rumors,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was hard for me at first, but I lived
      them down. I was very young then. I ought not to have accepted his
      sacrifice. I wish to heaven I had not. I wish that I had faced the scandal
      then. It is worse to be in the power of a man like this today! Mr.
      Aynesworth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that he has the right to keep those letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot answer that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I can&mdash;in accordance with my obligations to my employer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried him no further then, but rose and walked slowly out of the room.
      He found her maid, and saw them to their carriage. Then he returned to the
      sitting room. Wingrave was smoking a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying the humanizing influence,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Got rid of her
      ladyship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth has just gone,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you promised to steal the letters yet?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her dainty ladyship has not bid high enough, I suppose,&rdquo; he continued.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to open your mouth. There&rsquo;s another woman there besides
      the Lady Ruth Barrington, who opens bazaars, and patronizes charity, and
      entertains Royalty. Ask what you want and she&rsquo;ll pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brute you are!&rdquo; Aynesworth exclaimed involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I know that. But whose fault is it? It
      isn&rsquo;t mine. I&rsquo;ve lived the life of a brute creature for ten years. You
      don&rsquo;t abuse a one-legged man, poor devil. I&rsquo;ve had other things amputated.
      I was like you once. It seemed all right to me to go under to save a
      woman&rsquo;s honor. You never have. Therefore, I say you&rsquo;ve no right to call me
      a brute. Personally, I don&rsquo;t object. It is simply a matter of equity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit it,&rdquo; Aynesworth declared. &ldquo;You are acting like a brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. I didn&rsquo;t make myself what I am. Prison did it. Go and try ten
      years yourself, and you&rsquo;ll find you will have to grope about for your fine
      emotions. Are you coming to America with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saturday week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sport west, or civilization east?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;Here is a list of the kit which we shall
      require. Add yourself the things which I have forgotten. I pay for both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good of you,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d come without. Can you shoot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be particular about the rifles. I can take you to a little corner in
      Canada where the bears don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony. Put everything in hand,
      and be ready to come down to Cornwall with me on Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cornwall!&rdquo; Aynesworth exclaimed. &ldquo;What on earth are we going to do in
      Cornwall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an estate there, the home of my ancestors, which I am going to
      sell. I am the last of the Setons, fortunately, and I am going to smash
      the family tree, sell the heirlooms, and burn the family records!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t if I were you,&rdquo; Aynesworth said quietly. &ldquo;You are a young man
      yet. You may come back to your own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may smoke enough cigarettes to become actually humanized! One can
      never tell! I have known men proclaim themselves cynics for life, who have
      been making idiots of themselves with their own children in five years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But the one thing which no man can mistake is
      death. Listen, and I will quote some poetry to you. I think&mdash;it is
      something like this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The rivers of ice may melt, and the mountains crumble into dust, but the
      heart of a dead man is like the seed plot unsown. Green grass shall not
      sprout there, nor flowers blossom, nor shall all the ages of eternity show
      there any sign of life.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as though he had been reading from a child&rsquo;s Primer. When he had
      finished, he replaced his cigarette between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a dead man,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;Dead as the wildest seed plot in God&rsquo;s
      most forgotten acre!&rdquo;

      LORD OF THE MANOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      She came slowly towards the two men through the overgrown rose garden, a
      thin, pale, wild-eyed child, dressed in most uncompromising black. It was
      a matter of doubt whether she was the more surprised to see them, or they
      to find anyone else, in this wilderness of desolation. They stood face to
      face with her upon the narrow path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you lost your way?&rdquo; she inquired politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were told,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;that there was a gate in the wall
      there, through which we could get on to the cliffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The housekeeper,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I will not attempt to pronounce
      her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Tresfarwin,&rdquo; the child said. &ldquo;It is not really difficult. But she
      had no right to send you through here! It is all private, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked with a smile, &ldquo;you have permission, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have lived here all my life. I go where I please.
      Have you seen the pictures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just been looking at them,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they beautiful?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&mdash;oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat suddenly down on a rough wooden seat and commenced to cry. For the
      first time Wingrave looked at her with some apparent interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter with you, child?&rdquo; Aynesworth exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have loved them so all my life,&rdquo; she sobbed; &ldquo;the pictures, and the
      house, and the gardens, and now I have to go away! I don&rsquo;t know where!
      Nobody seems to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth looked down at her black frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lost someone, perhaps?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; she answered quietly. &ldquo;He was organist here, and he died last
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no other relatives?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all. No one&mdash;seems&mdash;quite to know&mdash;what is going
      to become of me!&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you staying now?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an old woman who used to look after our cottage,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But
      she is very poor, and she cannot keep me any longer. Mrs. Colson says that
      I must go and work, and I am afraid. I don&rsquo;t know anyone except at
      Tredowen! And I don&rsquo;t know how to work! And I don&rsquo;t want to go away from
      the pictures, and the garden, and the sea! It is all so beautiful, isn&rsquo;t
      it? Don&rsquo;t you love Tredowen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t been here very long, you see,&rdquo; Aynesworth explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave spoke for the first time. His eyes were fixed upon the child, and
      Aynesworth could see that she shrank from his cold, unsympathetic
      scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliet Lundy,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long was your father organist at the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Ever since I was born, and before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen next birthday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all that time,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;has there been no one living at Tredowen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one except Mrs. Tresfarwin,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It belongs to a very rich
      man who is in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave&rsquo;s face was immovable. He stood on one side, however, and turned
      towards his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are keeping this young lady,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;from what seems to be her
      daily pilgrimage. I wonder whether it is really the pictures, or Mrs.
      Tresfarwin&rsquo;s cakes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her shoulder upon him in silent scorn, and looked at Aynesworth
      a little wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand as he strolled after Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are, Mr. Lord of the Manor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t refuse to do
      something for the child. Her father was organist at your own church, and a
      hard struggle he must have had of it, with an absentee landlord, and a
      congregation of seagulls, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you joking?&rdquo; Wingrave asked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was never more in earnest in my life,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;The girl
      is come from gentlefolks. Did you see what a delicate face she had, and
      how nicely she spoke? You wouldn&rsquo;t have her sent out as a servant, would
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked at his companion ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a strange idea of the duties of a landlord,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Do
      you seriously suppose that I am responsible for the future of every brat
      who grows up on this estate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;You must own for yourself that this
      case is exceptional. Let us go down to the Vicarage and inquire about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;Nor will you! Do you
      see the spray coming over the cliffs there? The sea must be worth
      watching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth walked by his side in silence. He dared not trust himself to
      speak. Wingrave climbed with long, rapid strides to the summit of the
      headland, and stood there with his face turned seawards. The long breakers
      were sweeping in from the Atlantic with a low, insistent roar; as far as
      the eye could reach the waves were crusted with white foam. Every now and
      then the spray fell around the two men in a little dazzling shower; the
      very atmosphere was salt. About their heads the seagulls whirled and
      shrieked. From the pebbled beach to the horizon there was nothing to break
      the monotony of that empty waste of waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave stood perfectly motionless, with his eyes fixed upon the horizon.
      Minute after minute passed, and he showed no signs of moving. Aynesworth
      found himself presently engaged in watching him. Thoughts must be passing
      through his brain. He wondered what they were. It was here that he had
      spent his boyhood; barely an hour ago the two men had stood before the
      picture of his father. It was here, if anywhere, that he might regain some
      part of his older and more natural self. Was it a struggle, he wondered,
      that was going on within the man? There were no signs of it in his face.
      Simply he stood and looked, and looked, as though, by infinite
      perseverance, the very horizon itself might recede, and the thing for
      which he sought become revealed....
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth turned away at last, and there, not many yards behind,
      apparently watching them, stood the child. He waved his hand and advanced
      towards her. Her eyes were fixed upon Wingrave half fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid of the other gentleman,&rdquo; she whispered, as he reached her
      side. &ldquo;Will you come a little way with me? I will show you a seagull&rsquo;s
      nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left Wingrave where he was, and went hand in hand, along the cliff
      side. She was a curious mixture or shyness and courage. She talked very
      little, but she gripped her companion&rsquo;s fingers tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can show you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;where the seagulls build, and I can tell you
      the very spot in the sea where the sun goes down night after night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some baby seagulls in one of the nests, but I daren&rsquo;t go very
      near for the mother bird is so strong. Father used to say that when they
      have their baby birds to look after, they are as fierce as eagles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father used to walk with you here, Juliet?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always till the last few months when he got weaker and weaker,&rdquo; she
      answered. &ldquo;Since then I come every day alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find it lonely?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;not now. It makes me unhappy. Would you like to
      go down on the beach and look for shells? I can find you some very pretty
      ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They clambered down and wandered hand in hand by the seashore. She told
      him quaint little stories of the smugglers, of wrecks, and the legends of
      the fisher people. Coming back along the sands, she clung to his arm and
      grew more silent. Her eyes sought his every now and then, wistfully.
      Presently she pointed out a tiny whitewashed cottage standing by itself on
      a piece of waste ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where I live now, at least for a day or two,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They
      cannot keep me any longer. When are you going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon, I am afraid, little girl,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I will come and see
      you, though, before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promise,&rdquo; she said solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Aynesworth repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she held up her face, a little timidly, and he kissed her.
      Afterwards, he watched her turn with slow, reluctant footsteps to the
      unpromising abode which she had pointed out. Aynesworth made his way to
      the inn, cursing his impecuniosity and Wingrave&rsquo;s brutal indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the latter busy writing letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing your work, Aynesworth?&rdquo; he remarked coldly. &ldquo;Be so good as to write
      to Christie&rsquo;s for me, and ask them to send down a valuer to go through the
      pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really going to sell!&rdquo; Aynesworth exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;Heirlooms and family pictures are
      only so much rubbish to me. I am the last of my line, and I doubt whether
      even my lawyer could discover a next of kin for my personal property.
      Sell! Of course I&rsquo;m going to sell! What use is all this hoarded rubbish to
      me? I am going to turn it into gold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what use is gold?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked curiously. &ldquo;You have plenty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not enough for my purpose,&rdquo; Wingrave declared. &ldquo;We are going to America
      to make more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s vandalism!&rdquo; Aynesworth said, &ldquo;rank vandalism! The place as it is is
      a picture! The furniture and the house have grown old together. Why, you
      might marry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave scowled at the younger man across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fool, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;Take down these letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Wingrave went out alone. Aynesworth followed him about an
      hour later, when his work was done, and made his way towards the Vicarage.
      It was barely nine o&rsquo;clock, but the little house seemed already to be in
      darkness. He rang twice before anybody answered him. Then he heard slow,
      shuffling footsteps within, and a tall, gaunt man, in clerical attire, and
      carrying a small lamp, opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth made the usual apologies and was ushered into a bare,
      gloomy-looking apartment which, from the fact of its containing a writing
      table and a few books, he imagined must be the study. His host never asked
      him to sit down. He was a long, unkempt-looking man with a cold,
      forbidding face, and his manner was the reverse of cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have called to see you,&rdquo; Aynesworth explained, &ldquo;with reference to one
      of your parishioners&mdash;the daughter of your late organist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; the clergyman remarked solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her today for the first time and have only just heard her story,&rdquo;
       Aynesworth continued. &ldquo;It seems to be a very sad one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His listener inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, unfortunately, a poor man,&rdquo; Aynesworth continued, &ldquo;but I have some
      friends who are well off, and I could lay my hands upon a little ready
      money. I should like to discuss the matter with you and see if we cannot
      arrange something to give her a start in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite unnecessary,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;A connection of her father&rsquo;s has
      come forward at the last moment, who is able to do all that is required
      for her. Her future is provided for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth was a little taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I understood that she had
      neither friends nor relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were misinformed,&rdquo; the other answered. &ldquo;She has both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask who it is who has turned up so unexpectedly?&rdquo; Aynesworth
      inquired. &ldquo;I have taken a great fancy to the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman edged a little towards the door, and the coldness of his
      manner was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to seem discourteous,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I cannot recognize
      that you have any right to ask me these questions. You may accept my word
      that the child is to be fittingly provided for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth felt the color rising in his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you do not find my interest in her
      unwarrantable. My visit to you is simply a matter of charity. If my aid is
      unneeded, so much the better. All the same, I should like to know where
      she is going and who her friends are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not find myself at liberty to afford you any information,&rdquo; was the
      curt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon there was nothing left for Aynesworth to do but to put on his
      hat and walk out, which he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave met him in the hall on his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he asked a little sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a private errand,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, irritated by his words and
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my secretary,&rdquo; Wingrave said coldly. &ldquo;I do not pay you to go
      about executing private errands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth looked at him in surprise. Did he really wish to quarrel?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my time is my own when I have no work of
      yours on hand. If you think otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and looked at his employer significantly. Wingrave turned on his
      heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be so kind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as to settle the bill here tonight. We leave by
      the seven o&rsquo;clock train in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow!&rdquo; Aynesworth exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;if I follow by a later train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I need you in London directly we arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;that it is
      impossible for me to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think it a small thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have given my promise.
      I must see that child again before I go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are referring,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;to the black-frocked little creature we
      saw about the place yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave regarded his secretary as one might look at a person who has
      suddenly taken leave of his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to interfere with your engagements, but it is
      necessary that we should both leave by the seven o&rsquo;clock train tomorrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can see the child first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will come. If not, I will
      follow you at midday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the latter case,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;pray do not trouble to follow me
      unless your own affairs take you to London. Our connection will have
      ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean this?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my custom,&rdquo; Wingrave answered, &ldquo;to mean what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth set his alarm that night for half-past five. It seemed to him
      that his future would largely depend upon how soundly the child slept.

    <h2>
      THE HEART OF A CHILD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cottage, as Aynesworth neared it, showed no sign of life. The
      curtainless windows were blank and empty, no smoke ascended from the
      chimney. Its plastered front was innocent of any form of creeper, but in
      the few feet of garden in front a great, overgrown wild rose bush, starred
      with deep red blossoms, perfumed the air. As he drew near, the door
      suddenly opened, and with a little cry of welcome the child rushed out to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely of you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I saw you coming from my window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are up early,&rdquo; he said, smiling down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun woke me,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It always does. I was going down to the
      sands. Shall we go together? Or would you like to go into the gardens at
      Tredowen? The flowers are beautiful there while the dew is on them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;that I cannot do either. I have come
      to say goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light died out of her face all of a sudden. The delicate beauty of her
      gleaming eyes and quivering mouth had vanished. She was once more the
      pale, wan little child he had seen coming slowly up the garden path at
      Tredowen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going&mdash;so soon!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and led her away over the short green turf of the common.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We only came for a few hours,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;But I have good news for
      you, Juliet, unless you know already. Mr. Saunders has found out some of
      your friends. They are going to look after you properly, and you will not
      be alone any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time are you going?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly child,&rdquo; he answered, giving her hand a shake. &ldquo;Listen to what I am
      telling you. You are going to have friends to look after you always.
      Aren&rsquo;t you glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not glad,&rdquo; she answered passionately. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go away.
      I am&mdash;lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her arms suddenly sought his neck, and her face was buried on his
      shoulder. He soothed her as well as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go, little girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for I am off to America almost at
      once. As soon as I can after I come back, I will come and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only been here one day,&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would stay if I could, dear,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;Come, dry those
      eyes and be a brave girl. Think how nice it will be to go and live with
      people who will take care of you properly, and be fond of you. Why, you
      may have a pony, and all sorts of nice things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a pony,&rdquo; she answered, hanging on his arm. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
      go away. I want to stay here&mdash;and wait till you come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when I come back, little woman,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you will be almost
      grown up. Come, dry your eyes now, and I tell you what we will do. You
      shall come back with me to breakfast, and then drive up to the station and
      see us off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to come,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;but I am afraid of the other
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;If we do, he won&rsquo;t
      hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like his face!&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t look at it,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;But breakfast we must
      have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were half way through the meal, and Juliet had quite recovered her
      spirits when Wingrave entered. He looked at the two with impassive face,
      and took his place at the table. He wished the child &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;
       carelessly, but made no remark as to her presence there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been telling Juliet some good news,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked. &ldquo;I
      went to see Mr. Saunders, the Vicar here, last night, and he has found out
      some of her father&rsquo;s friends. They are going to look after her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave showed no interest in the information. But a moment later he
      addressed Juliet for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you glad that you are going away from Tredowen?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very, very sorry,&rdquo; she answered, the tears gathering once more in
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you want to go to school, don&rsquo;t you, and see other girls?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will break my heart,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;to leave Tredowen. I think
      that if I have to go away from the pictures and the garden, and the sea, I
      shall never be happy any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a child,&rdquo; he remarked contemptuously; &ldquo;you do not understand. If
      you go away, you can learn to paint pictures yourself like those at
      Tredowen. You will find that the world is full of other beautiful places!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sympathetic aspect of his words was altogether destroyed by the thin
      note of careless irony, which even the child understood. She felt that he
      was mocking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could never be happy,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;away from Tredowen. You
      understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she added, turning confidentially to Aynesworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so now, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but remember that you are very young.
      There are many things for you to learn before you grow up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a dunce,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I can talk French and German, and do
      arithmetic, and play the organ. Father used to teach me these things. I
      can learn at Tredowen very well. I hope that my friends will let me stay
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave took no more notice of her. She and Aynesworth walked together to
      the station. As they passed the little whitewashed cottage, she suddenly
      let go his hand, and darted inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait one moment,&rdquo; she cried breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reappeared almost at once, holding something tightly clenched in her
      right hand. She showed it to him shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for you, please,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a silver locket, and inside was a little picture of herself.
      Aynesworth stooped down and kissed her. He had had as many presents in his
      life as most men, but never an offering which came to him quite like that!
      They stood still for a moment, and he held out her hands. Already the
      morning was astir. The seagulls were wheeling, white-winged and noiseless,
      above their heads; the air was fragrant with the scent of cottage flowers.
      Like a low, sweet undernote, the sea came rolling in upon the firm sands&mdash;out
      to the west it stretched like a sheet of softly swaying inland water. For
      those few moments there seemed no note of discord&mdash;and then the harsh
      whistle of an approaching train! They took hold of hands and ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, perhaps, as well that their farewells were cut short. There was
      scarcely time for more than a few hurried words before the train moved out
      from the queer little station, and with his head out of the window,
      Aynesworth waved his hand to the black-frocked child with her pale, eager
      face already stained with tears&mdash;a lone, strange little figure, full
      of a sort of plaintive grace as she stood there, against a background of
      milk cans, waving a crumpled handkerchief!
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave, who had been buried in a morning paper, looked up presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If our journeyings,&rdquo; he remarked drily, &ldquo;are to contain everywhere
      incidents such as these, they will become a sort of sentimental
      pilgrimage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my interest in the child has annoyed you. At
      any rate, it is over now. The parson was mysterious, but he assured me
      that she was provided for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked across the carriage with cold, reflective curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your point of view,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;is a mystery to me! I cannot see how
      the future of an unfledged brat like that can possibly concern you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;but you must remember that you are a
      little out of touch with your fellows just now. I daresay when you were my
      age, you would have felt as I feel. I daresay that as the years go on, you
      will feel like it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave was thoughtful for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that I may yet have in me the making of a
      sentimentalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth returned his gaze as steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can never tell,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You may change, of course. I hope that
      you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are candid, at any rate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;that there is any happiness in
      life for the man who lives entirely apart from his fellow creatures. Not
      to feel is not to live. I think that the first real act of kindness which
      you feel prompted to perform will mark the opening of a different life for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave spread out the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, with a faint sneer, &ldquo;that it is quite time you took
      this sea voyage.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Lumley Barrington, K.C. and M.P., was in the act of stepping into his
      carriage to drive down to the House, when he was intercepted by a message.
      It was his wife&rsquo;s maid, who came hurrying out after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but her ladyship particularly wished
      to see you as soon as you came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your mistress in?&rdquo; Barrington asked in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; the maid answered. &ldquo;Her ladyship is resting, before she goes
      to the ball at Caleram House. She is in her room now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come up at once,&rdquo; Barrington said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept the carriage waiting while he ascended to his wife&rsquo;s room. There
      was no answer to his knock. He opened the door softly. She was asleep on a
      couch drawn up before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the room noiselessly, and stood looking down upon her. Her
      lithe, soft figure had fallen into a posture of graceful, almost
      voluptuous ease; the ribbons and laces of her muslin dressing gown
      quivered gently with her deep regular breathing. She had thrown off her
      slippers, and one long, slender foot was exposed; the other was doubled up
      underneath her body. Her face was almost like the face of a child, smooth
      and unwrinkled, save for one line by the eyes where she laughed. He looked
      at her steadfastly. Could the closing of the eyes, indeed, make all the
      difference? Life and the knowledge of life seemed things far from her
      consciousness. Could one look like that&mdash;even in sleep&mdash;and
      underneath&mdash;! Barrington broke away from his train of thought, and
      woke her quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up and yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parsons managed to catch you, then,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I was just off. I got away from Wills&rsquo; dinner party
      early, and called here for some notes. I must be at the House&rdquo;&mdash;he
      glanced at the clock&mdash;&ldquo;in three-quarters of an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you as long as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his, a little furtively, full of inquiry. &ldquo;I have done what
      you wished,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I called at the Clarence Hotel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! He sent back my card. He declined to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She showed no sign of disappointment. She sat up and looked into the fire,
      smoothing her hair mechanically with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; Barrington continued, &ldquo;I could see no object whatever in my
      visit. I have nothing to say to him, nor, I should think, he to me. I am
      sorry for him, of course, but he&rsquo;d never believe me if I told him so. What
      happened to him was partly my fault, and unless he&rsquo;s changed, he&rsquo;s not
      likely to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swayed a little towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was partly&mdash;also&mdash;mine,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that at all,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;You at any rate were blameless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him, and he was astonished to find how pale she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not!&rdquo; she said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence. Barrington had the air of a man who has
      received a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth!&rdquo; he exclaimed, glancing towards the door, and speaking almost in a
      whisper. &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;that there are things which I have never
      known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I mean that he might, if he chose, do us now&mdash;both
      of us&mdash;an immense amount of harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington sat down at the end of the sofa. He knew his wife well enough
      to understand that this was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us understand one another, Ruth,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I always thought
      that you were a little severe on Wingrave at the trial! He may bear you a
      grudge for that; it is very possible that he does. But what can he do now?
      He had his chance to cross examine you, and he let it go by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has some letters of mine,&rdquo; Lady Ruth said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters! Written before the trial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he not make use of them there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had,&rdquo; Lady Ruth said, with her eyes fixed upon the carpet, &ldquo;the
      sympathy would have been the other way. He would have got off with a much
      lighter sentence, and you&mdash;would not have married me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Barrington muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Lady Ruth continued, resting her hand upon her husband&rsquo;s coat
      sleeve, &ldquo;the thing happened all in a second. I had the check in my hand
      when you and Sir William came crashing through that window, and Sir
      William&rsquo;s eyes were upon me. The only way to save myself was to repudiate
      it, and let Wingrave get out of the affair as well as he could. Of course,
      I never guessed what was going to happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was Wingrave,&rdquo; Barrington muttered, &ldquo;who played the game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Lady Ruth answered quietly. &ldquo;But I am not so sure about him now.
      You and I, Lumley, know one another a little better today than we did
      twelve years ago. We have had a few of the corners knocked off, I suppose.
      I can tell you things now I didn&rsquo;t care to then. Wingrave had lent me
      money before! He has letters from me today, thanking him for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington was a large, florid man, well built and well set up. In court
      he presented rather a formidable appearance with his truculent chin, his
      straight, firm mouth, and his commanding presence. Yet there was nothing
      about him now which would have inspired fear in the most nervous of
      witnesses. He looked like a man all broken up by some unexpected shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had produced those letters&mdash;at the trial&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I risked it, anyhow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had to. My story was the only one
      which gave me a dog&rsquo;s chance, and I didn&rsquo;t mean to go under&mdash;then.
      Wingrave never gave me away, but I fancy he&rsquo;s feeling differently about it
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know, Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen him! He sent for me!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Lumley, don&rsquo;t look at me
      like that! We&rsquo;re not in the nursery, you and I. I went because I had to.
      He&rsquo;s going to America for a time, and then he&rsquo;s coming back here. I think
      that when he comes back&mdash;he means mischief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not the sort of man to forget,&rdquo; Barrington said, half to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered ever so slightly. Then she stretched out a long white arm,
      and drawing his head suddenly down to her, kissed him on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;he would give up the letters! Without them, he
      might say&mdash;anything. No one would believe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington raised his eyes to hers. There was something almost pathetic in
      the worshiping light which shone there. He was, as he had always been, her
      abject slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you think of any way?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Shall I go to him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Useless!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You have nothing to offer in exchange. He would
      not give them to me. He surely would not give them to you. Shall I tell
      you what is in his mind? Listen, then! He is rich now; he means to make
      more money there. Then he will return, calling himself Mr. Wingrave&mdash;an
      American&mdash;with imaginary letters of introduction to us. He has
      ambitions&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what they are, but they seem to entail his
      holding some sort of a place in society. We are to be his sponsors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it practicable?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He is absolutely unrecognizable now. He has
      changed cruelly. Can&rsquo;t you imagine the horror of it? He will be always in
      evidence; always with those letters in the background. He means to make
      life a sort of torture chamber for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better defy him at once, and get over,&rdquo; Barrington said. &ldquo;After all,
      don&rsquo;t you think that the harm he could do is a little imaginary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brushed the suggestion aside with a little shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what he would do, Lumley?&rdquo; she said, leaning towards
      him. &ldquo;He would have my letters, and a copy of my evidence, printed in an
      elegant little volume and distributed amongst my friends. It would come
      one day like a bomb, and nothing that you or I could do would alter it in
      the least. Your career and my social position would be ruined. Success
      brings enemies, you know, Lumley, and I have rather more than my share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we are helpless,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless we can get the letters&mdash;or unless he should never return from
      America,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrington moved uneasily in his seat. He knew very well that some scheme
      was already forming in his wife&rsquo;s brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is anything that I can do,&rdquo; he said in a low tone, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
      afraid to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one chance,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;a sort of forlorn hope, but you
      might try it. He has a secretary, a young man named Aynesworth. If he were
      on our side&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; Barrington interrupted, &ldquo;that you would have more
      chance with him than I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You foolish man,&rdquo; she said, touching his fingers lightly. &ldquo;I believe you
      think that I am irresistible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen a good many lions tamed,&rdquo; he reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Anyhow, there is one here who seems quite insensible. I have
      talked already with Mr. Aynesworth. He would not listen to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; she continued softy, &ldquo;of one thing I am very sure. Every
      man is like every woman; he is vulnerable if you can discover the right
      spot and the right weapons. Mr. Aynesworth is not a woman&rsquo;s man, but I
      fancy that he is ambitious. I thought that you might go and see him. He
      has rooms somewhere in Dorset Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet. A glance at the clock reminded him of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will do what I can. I think, dear,&rdquo; he added,
      bending over her to say farewell, &ldquo;that you should have been the man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I such a failure as a woman, then?&rdquo; she asked with a swift upward
      glance. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Lumley. My woman will be here to dress me
      directly. You must really go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode down the stairs with tingling pulses, and drove to the House,
      where his speech, a little florid in its rhetoric, and verbose as became
      the man, was nevertheless a great success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a clever fellow, Barrington,&rdquo; one of his acquaintances remarked,
      &ldquo;when you get him away from his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      A FORLORN HOPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aynesworth ceased tugging at the strap of his portmanteau, and rose slowly
      to his feet. A visitor had entered his rooms&mdash;apparently unannounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must apologize,&rdquo; the newcomer said, &ldquo;for my intrusion. Your
      housekeeper, I presume it was, whom I saw below, told me to come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth pushed forward a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I believe that I am addressing Mr. Lumley
      Barrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not altogether without embarrassment, Barrington seated himself. Something
      of his ordinary confidence of bearing and demeanor had certainly deserted
      him. His manner, too, was nervous. He had the air of being altogether ill
      at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must apologize further, Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for an
      apparently ill-timed visit. You are, I see, on the eve of a journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am leaving for America tomorrow,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Sir Wingrave Seton, I presume?&rdquo; Barrington remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrington hesitated for a moment. Aynesworth was civil, but inquiring. He
      felt himself very awkwardly placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must throw myself upon your consideration.
      You can possibly surmise the reason of my visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I must plead guilty to denseness&mdash;in
      this particular instance, at any rate. I am altogether at a loss to
      account for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had some conversation with my wife, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you proceed, Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; Barrington interrupted, &ldquo;one word.
      You are aware that Sir Wingrave Seton is in possession of certain
      documents in which my wife is interested, which he refuses to give up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have understood that such is the case,&rdquo; Aynesworth admitted. &ldquo;Will you
      pardon me if I add that it is a matter which I can scarcely discuss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it go, for the moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is something else which I
      want to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth nodded a little curtly. He was not very favorably impressed
      with his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington leaned forward in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have made for yourself some reputation as
      a writer. Your name has been familiar to me for some time. I was at
      college, I believe, with your uncle, Stanley Aynesworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. Aynesworth said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; Barrington continued impressively, &ldquo;what has induced you
      to accept a position with such a man as Seton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; Aynesworth declared, &ldquo;is easily answered. I was not looking for a
      secretaryship at all, or anything of the sort, but I chanced to hear his
      history one night, and I was curious to analyze, so far as possible, his
      attitude towards life and his fellows, on his reappearance in it. That is
      the whole secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington leaned back in his chair, and glanced thoughtfully at his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the story of his misadventures, then?&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about his imprisonment, and the cause of it,&rdquo; Aynesworth said
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrington was silent for several moments. He felt that he was receiving
      but scanty encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it worth while, Mr. Aynesworth?&rdquo; he asked at length. &ldquo;There is better
      work for you in the world than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Aynesworth preferred to reply by a gesture only. Barrington was
      watching him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A political secretaryship, Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;might lead you
      anywhere. If you are ambitious, it is the surest of all stepping stones
      into the House. After that, your career is in your own hands. I offer you
      such a post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am exceedingly obliged to you,&rdquo; Aynesworth replied, &ldquo;but I scarcely
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have influence,&rdquo; Barrington said, &ldquo;which I have never cared to use on
      my own account. I am willing to use it on yours. You have only to say the
      word, and the matter is arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only repeat,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, &ldquo;that I am exceedingly obliged to
      you, Mr. Barrington, but I cannot understand why you should interest
      yourself so much on my behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish me to speak in plain words,&rdquo; Barrington said, &ldquo;I will do so.
      I ask you to aid me as a man of honor in the restoration of those letters
      to my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot do it,&rdquo; Aynesworth said firmly. &ldquo;I am sorry that you should have
      come to me with such an offer. It is quite out of the question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not decide too hastily,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember this. Sir Wingrave Seton
      had once an opportunity of putting those letters to any use he may have
      thought fit. He ignored it. At that time, their tenor and contents might
      easily have been explained. After all these years, that task would be far
      more difficult. I say that no man has a right to keep a woman&rsquo;s letters
      back from her years after any friendship there may have been between them
      is over. It is not the action of an honorable man. Sir Wingrave Seton has
      placed himself outside the pale of honorable men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your judgment,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered quietly, &ldquo;seems to me severe. Sir
      Wingrave Seton has been the victim of peculiar circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington looked at his companion thoughtfully. He was wondering exactly
      how much he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You defend him,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;That is because you have not yet found out
      what manner of man he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;I am not his judge. Mr. Barrington,&rdquo;
       he added, &ldquo;You must forgive me if I remind you that this is a somewhat
      unprofitable discussion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short silence followed. With Barrington it did not appear to be a
      silence of irresolution. He was leaning a little forward in his chair, and
      his head was resting upon his hand. Of his companion he seemed for the
      moment to have become oblivious. Aynesworth watched him curiously. Was he
      looking back through the years, he wondered, to that one brief but lurid
      chapter of history; or was it his own future of which he was thinking,&mdash;a
      future which, to the world, must seem so full of brilliant possibilities,
      and yet which he himself must feel to be so fatally and miserably
      insecure?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I suppose from a crude point of view I
      am here to bribe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it worth while?&rdquo; he asked a little wearily. &ldquo;I have tried to be civil&mdash;but
      I have also tried to make you understand. Your task is absolutely
      hopeless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It should not be,&rdquo; Barrington persisted. &ldquo;This is one of those rare
      cases, in which anything is justifiable. Seton had his chance at the
      trial. He chose to keep silence. I do not praise him or blame him for
      that. It was the only course open to a man of honor. I maintain that his
      silence then binds him to silence for ever. He has no right to ruin my
      life and the happiness of my wife by subtle threats, to hold those foolish
      letters over our heads, like a thunderbolt held ever in suspense. You are
      ambitious, I believe, Mr. Aynesworth! Get me those letters, and I will
      make you my secretary, find you a seat in Parliament, and anything else in
      reason that you will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth rose to his feet. He wished to intimate that, so far as he was
      concerned, the interview was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your proposition, Mr. Barrington,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is absolutely impossible. In
      the first place, I have no idea where the letters in question are, and Sir
      Wingrave is never likely to suffer them to pass into my charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have opportunities of finding out,&rdquo; Barrington suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And secondly,&rdquo; Aynesworth continued, ignoring the interruption, &ldquo;whatever
      the right or the wrong of this matter may be, I am in receipt of a salary
      from Sir Wingrave Seton, and I cannot betray his confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington also rose to his feet. He was beginning to recognize the
      hopelessness of his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is final, Mr. Aynesworth?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; was the firm reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrington bowed stiffly, and moved towards the door. On the threshold he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly, &ldquo;that you will not regard
      this as an ordinary attempt at bribery and corruption. I have simply asked
      you to aid me in setting right a great injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a subtle distinction, Mr. Barrington,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;but I
      will endeavor to keep in mind your point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington drove straight home, and made his way directly to his study.
      Now that he was free from his wife&rsquo;s influence, and looked back upon his
      recent interview, he realized for the first time the folly and indignity
      of the whole proceedings. He was angry that, a man of common sense, keen
      witted and farseeing in the ordinary affairs of life, should have placed
      himself so completely in a false, not to say a humiliating position. And
      then, just as suddenly, he forgot all about himself, and remembered only
      her. With a breath of violets, and the delicate rustling of half-lifted
      skirts, she had come softly into the room, and stood looking at him
      inquiringly. Her manner seemed to indicate more a good-natured curiosity
      than real anxiety. She made a little grimace as he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have failed,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;That young man is a prig!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that he would be obstinate. Men with eyes of
      that color always are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do, Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we?&rdquo; she answered calmly. &ldquo;Nothing but wait. He is going to
      America. It is a terrible country for accidents. Something may happen to
      him there! Do go and change your things, there&rsquo;s a dear, and look in at
      the Westinghams&rsquo; for me for an hour. We&rsquo;ll just get some supper and come
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be ready in ten minutes,&rdquo; Barrington answered. He understood that
      he was to ask no questions, nor did he. But all the time his man was
      hurrying him into his clothes, his brain was busy weaving fancies.

    <h2>
      PROFESSOR SINCLAIR&rsquo;S DANCING ACADEMY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Sinclair, or as he preferred to be called, Professor Sinclair, waved a
      white kid glove in the direction of the dancing hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, ladies and gentlemen!&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;A beautiful valse just
      about to commence. Tickets, if you please! Ah! Glad to see you, Miss
      Cullingham! You&rsquo;ll find&mdash;a friend of yours inside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of giggling as the girls came out from the little
      dressing room and joined their waiting escorts, who stood in a line
      against the wall, mostly struggling with refractory gloves. Mr. Sinclair,
      proprietor of the West Islington Dancing Academy, and host of these little
      gatherings&mdash;for a consideration of eighteenpence&mdash;did his best,
      by a running fire of conversation, to set everyone at their ease. He wore
      a somewhat rusty frock coat, black trousers, a white dress waistcoat, and
      a red tie. Evening dress was not DE RIGUEUR! The money at the door, and
      that everyone should behave as ladies and gentlemen, were the only things
      insisted upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sinclair&rsquo;s best smile and most correct bow was suddenly in evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Violet!&rdquo; he exclaimed to a lady who came in alone, &ldquo;we are
      enchanted. We feared that you had deserted us. There is a young gentleman
      inside who is going to be made very happy. One shilling change, thank you.
      Won&rsquo;t you step into the cloak room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, Mr. Sinclair,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I would rather keep my hat
      and veil on. I can only stay for a few minutes. Is Mr. Richardson here, do
      you know? Ah! I can see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped past the Professor into the little dancing hall. A young lady
      was pounding upon a piano, a boy at her side was playing the violin. A few
      couples were dancing, but most of the company was looking on. The evening
      was young, and Mr. Sinclair, who later on officiated as M.C., had not yet
      made his attack upon the general shyness. The lady known as Mademoiselle
      Violet paused and looked around her. Suddenly she caught sight of a pale,
      anemic-looking youth, who was standing apart from the others, lounging
      against the wall. She moved rapidly towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Richardson?&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, and a sudden rush of color streamed into his cheeks. He took
      her hand awkwardly, and he was almost speechless with nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re at all glad to see me!&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Miss Violet!&rdquo; he exclaimed. He would have said more, but the words
      stuck in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we sit down somewhere?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were one or two chairs placed behind a red drugget curtain, where
      adventurous spirits led their partners later in the evening. They found a
      place there, and the young man recovered his power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not glad to see you!&rdquo; he exclaimed almost vehemently. &ldquo;Why, what else do
      you suppose I come here for every Thursday evening? I never dance; they
      all make game of me because they know I come here on the chance of seeing
      you again. I&rsquo;m a fool! I know that! You just amuse yourself here with me,
      and then you go away, back to your friends&mdash;and forget! And I hang
      about round here, like the silly ass that I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man blushed at the sound of his Christian name. He was mollified
      despite himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s got to be the same thing all over again,&rdquo; he declared
      resignedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll talk to me and let me be near you&mdash;and make a
      fool of me all round; and then you&rsquo;ll go away, and heaven knows when I&rsquo;ll
      see you again. You won&rsquo;t let me take you home, and won&rsquo;t tell me where you
      live, or who your friends are. You do treat me precious badly, Miss
      Violet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;it will not be the same. I have something
      quite serious to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something serious&mdash;you? Go on!&rdquo; he exclaimed in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you found another place yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I haven&rsquo;t really tried. I have a little money saved, and I could get
      one tomorrow if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him with a smiling gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted to know whether it
      would be possible for you to go away for a little time, if someone paid
      all your expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go away!&rdquo; he repeated blankly. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Violet leaned a little nearer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress asked me yesterday,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I knew anyone who could be
      trusted who would go away, at a moment&rsquo;s notice, on an errand for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mistress,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You really are a lady&rsquo;s maid, then, are
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; she answered impatiently. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you so before? Now
      what do you say? Will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; he answered thoughtfully. &ldquo;If it had been for you, I don&rsquo;t know
      that I&rsquo;d have minded. I ain&rsquo;t fond of traveling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for me,&rdquo; she interrupted hastily. &ldquo;If I can find her anyone who
      will do what she wants, she will make my fortune. She has promised. And
      then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Violet looked at him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not make any promises,&rdquo; she said demurely, &ldquo;but things would
      certainly be different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s blood was stirred. Mademoiselle Violet stood to him for
      the whole wonderful world of romance, into which he had peered dimly from
      behind the counter of an Islington emporium. Her low voice&mdash;so
      strange to his ears after the shrill chatter of the young ladies of his
      acquaintance&mdash;the mystery of her coming and going, all went to give
      color to the single dream of his unimaginative life. Apart from her, he
      was a somewhat vulgar, entirely commonplace young man, of saving habits,
      and with some aptitude for business, in a small way. He had been well on
      his way to becoming a small but successful shopkeeper, thereby realizing
      the only ideals which had yet presented themselves to him, when Madame
      Violet had unconsciously intervened. Of what might become of him now he
      had no clear conception of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Violet&rsquo;s eyes flashed behind her veil. Her fingers touched
      his for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long way,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he answered valiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To&mdash;America!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;America!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;But&mdash;is this a joke, Miss Violet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not! America is not a great journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will cost&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress is very rich,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The cost does not matter at all.
      You will have all the money you can spend&mdash;and more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself short of breath, and bereft of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat there in silence for a few moments. A promenading couple put
      their heads behind the screen, and withdrew with the sound of feminine
      giggling. Outside, the piano was being thumped to the tune of a popular
      polka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what have I go to do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To watch a man who will go out by the same steamer as you,&rdquo; she answered.
      &ldquo;Write to London, tell me what he does, how he spends his time, whether he
      is ill or well. You must stay at the same hotel in New York, and try and
      find out what his business is there. Remember, we want to know, my
      mistress and I, everything that he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;A friend of your mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she answered shortly, &ldquo;an enemy. A cruel enemy&mdash;the cruelest
      enemy a woman could have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The subdued passion of her tone thrilled him. He felt himself bewildered&mdash;in
      touch with strange things. She leaned a little closer towards him, and
      that mysterious perfume, which was one of her many fascinations, dazed him
      with its sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could send home word,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that he was ill, that
      anything had happened to him, that he was not likely to return&mdash;our
      fortunes would be made&mdash;yours and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You&mdash;phew! It&rsquo;s hot here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wiped the perspiration recklessly from his forehead with a red silk
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you come to me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know the name of your
      mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must not ask it,&rdquo; she declared quietly. &ldquo;It is better for you not
      to know. I came to you because you were a man, and I knew that I could
      trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her flattery sank into his soul. No one else had ever called him a man. He
      felt himself capable of great things. To think that, but for the coming of
      this wonderful Mademoiselle Violet, he might even now have been furnishing
      a small shop on the outskirts of Islington, with collars and ties and
      gloves designed to attract the youth of that populous neighborhood!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do I start?&rdquo; he asked with a coolness which surprised himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a heavy packet from the recesses of the muff she carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the particulars are here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The name of the steamer, the
      name of the man, and money. You will be told where to get more in New
      York, if you need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took it from her mechanically. She rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember,&rdquo; she said, looking into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t likely to forget anything you&rsquo;ve said tonight,&rdquo; he answered
      honestly. &ldquo;But look here! Let me take you home&mdash;just this once! Give
      me something to think about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you something to hope for,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You must not come
      a yard with me. When you come back it will, perhaps&mdash;be different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remained behind the partition, gripping the packet tightly.
      Mademoiselle Violet took a hasty adieu of Mr. Sinclair, and descended to
      the street. She walked for a few yards, and then turned sharply to the
      left. A hansom, into which she stepped at once, was waiting there. She
      wrapped herself hastily in a long fur coat which lay upon the seat, and
      thrust her hand through the trap door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Martin&rsquo;s Schoolroom!&rdquo; she told the cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Mademoiselle Violet combined a taste for philanthropy with her
      penchant for Islington dancing halls. She entered the little schoolroom
      and made her way to the platform, dispensing many smiles and nods amongst
      the audience of the concert, which was momentarily interrupted for her
      benefit. She was escorted on to the platform by a young and
      earnest-looking clergyman, and given a chair in the center of the little
      group who were gathered there. And after the conclusion of the song, the
      clergyman expressed his gratification to the audience that a lady with so
      many calls upon her time, such high social duties, should yet find time to
      show her deep interest in their welfare by this most kind visit. After
      which, he ventured to call upon Lady Barrington to say a few words.

    <h2>
      MEPHISTOPHELES ON A STEAMER
    </h2>
    <p>
      In some respects, the voyage across the Atlantic was a surprise to
      Aynesworth. His companion seemed to have abandoned, for the time at any
      rate, his habit of taciturnity. He conversed readily, if a little stiffly,
      with his fellow passengers. He divided his time between the smoke room and
      the deck, and very seldom sought the seclusion of his state room.
      Aynesworth remarked upon this change one night as the two men paced the
      deck after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are beginning to find more pleasure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in talking to
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; he answered coldly. &ldquo;It is extremely distasteful to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you do it?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave never objected to being asked questions by his secretary. He
      seemed to recognize the fact that Aynesworth&rsquo;s retention of his post was
      due to a desire to make a deliberate study of himself, and while his own
      attitude remained purely negative, he at no time exhibited any resentment
      or impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do it for several reasons,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;First, because misanthropy is
      a luxury in which I cannot afford to indulge. Secondly, because I am
      really curious to know whether the time will ever return when I shall feel
      the slightest shadow of interest in any human being. I can only discover
      this by affecting a toleration for these people&rsquo;s society, which I can
      assure you, if you are curious about the matter, is wholly assumed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you find Mrs. Travers entertaining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the lady with a stock of epigrams, and a green veil?&rdquo; he
      remarked. &ldquo;No! I do not find her entertaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your neighbor at table then, Miss Packe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my affections have perished,&rdquo; Wingrave answered grimly, &ldquo;my taste, I
      hope, is unimpaired. The young person who travels to improve her mind, and
      fills up the gaps by reading Baedeker on the places she hasn&rsquo;t been to,
      fails altogether to interest me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little severe?&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Wingrave answered, &ldquo;that it depends upon the point of view,
      to use a hackneyed phrase. You study people with a discerning eye for good
      qualities. Nature&mdash;and circumstances have ordered it otherwise with
      me. I see them through darkened glasses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the way to happiness,&rdquo; Aynesworth said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no highroad to what you term happiness,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;One
      holds the string and follows into the maze. But one does not choose one&rsquo;s
      way. You are perhaps more fortunate than I that you can appreciate Mrs.
      Travers&rsquo; wit, and find my neighbor, who has done Europe, attractive. That
      is a matter of disposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked, &ldquo;to have known you fifteen years
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I was a fairly average person&mdash;I mean that
      I was possessed of an average share of the humanities. I have only my
      memory to go by. I am one of those fortunate persons, you see, who have
      realized an actual reincarnation. I have the advantage of having looked
      out upon life from two different sets of windows.&mdash;By the bye,
      Aynesworth, have you noticed that unwholesome-looking youth in a serge
      suit there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy that he must know&mdash;my history. He sits all day long smoking
      bad cigarettes and watching me. He makes clumsy attempts to enter into
      conversation with me. He is interested in us for some reason or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shocking young bounder,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk to him some time, and find out what he means by it,&rdquo; Wingrave said.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to find my biography in the American newspapers. It might
      interfere with my operations there. Here&rsquo;s this woman coming to worry us!
      You take her off, Aynesworth! I shall go into the smoking room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Travers was not so easily to be disposed of. For some reason or
      other, she had shown a disposition to attach herself to Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please put me in my chair,&rdquo; she said to him, holding out her rug and
      cushion. &ldquo;No! Not you, Mr. Aynesworth. Mr. Wingrave understands so much
      better how to wrap me up. Thanks! Won&rsquo;t you sit down yourself? It&rsquo;s much
      better for you out here than in the smoking room&mdash;and we might go on
      with our argument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, accepting her invitation after a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation, &ldquo;that we were to abandon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before dinner,&rdquo; she answered, glancing sideways at him. &ldquo;I feel
      braver now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are prepared,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;for unconditional surrender?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him again. She had rather nice eyes, quite dark and very
      soft, and she was a great believer in their efficacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my argument?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer her for a moment. He had turned his head slightly
      towards her, and though his face was, as usual, expressionless, and his
      eyes cold and hard, she found nevertheless something of meaning in his
      steady regard. There was a flush in her cheek when she looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that you are rather a terrible person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You flatter me,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I am really quite harmless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from conviction then, I am sure,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Let us call it from lack of enterprise! The
      virtues are all very admirable things, but it is the men and women with
      vices who have ruled the world. The good die young because there is no
      useful work for them to do. No really satisfactory person, from a moral
      point of view, ever achieved greatness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She half closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head is going round,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;What an upheaval! Fancy
      Mephistopheles on a steamer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was, at any rate, the most interesting of that little trio,&rdquo; Wingrave
      remarked, &ldquo;but even he was a trifle heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you go about the world preaching your new doctrines?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Nothing would every make a missionary of me, for
      good or for evil, for the simple reason that no one else&rsquo;s welfare except
      my own has the slightest concern for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hideous selfishness!&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;you
      quite mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you I do,&rdquo; he answered drily. &ldquo;My world consists of myself
      for the central figure, and the half a dozen or so of people who are
      useful or amusing to me! Except that the rest are needed to keep moving
      the machinery of the world, they might all perish, so far as I was
      concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; Mrs. Travers said softly, &ldquo;that I should like to be in
      your world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can very easily believe you,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; she remarked tentatively, &ldquo;I came to convert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something in that,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;It would be a great work, a
      little difficult, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more interesting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I am not only bad, but I admire badness. My wish
      is to remain bad&mdash;in fact, I should like to be worse if I knew how.
      You would find it hard to make a start. I couldn&rsquo;t even admit that a state
      of goodness was desirable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him curiously. The night air was perhaps getting colder, for
      she shivered, and drew the rug a little closer around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak like a prophet,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prophet of evil then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him steadfastly. The lightness had gone out of her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am almost sorry that I ever knew you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done you the greatest service one human being can render another!
      I have saved you from being bored!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be true,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But can you conceive no worse state in
      the world than being bored?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no worse state,&rdquo; he answered drily. &ldquo;I was bored once,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;for ten years or so; I ought to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you married?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so bad as that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I was in prison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned a startled face towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly true,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;Are you horrified?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; she asked in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I killed a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purposely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He attacked me! I had to defend myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Sit still,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am frightened of you, but I don&rsquo;t want
      you to go away. I want to think.... Yes! I can understand you better now!
      Your life was spoilt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am still young! I am going to make up for
      those ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The years can carry no more than their
      ordinary burden of sensations. If you try to fill them too full, you lose
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try what I can do!&rdquo; he remarked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid of you tonight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am going downstairs. Will you
      give my rug and cushion to the deck steward? And&mdash;good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her hand, but she did not look at him, and she hurried away a
      little abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave yawned, and lighting a cigar, strolled up and down the deck. A
      figure loomed out of the darkness and almost ran into him. It was the
      young man in the serge suit. He muttered a clumsy apology and hurried on.

    <h2>
      A COCKNEY CONSPIRATOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bar closes in ten minutes, sir!&rdquo; the smoking room steward announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man who had been the subject of Wingrave&rsquo;s remarks hastily
      ordered another drink, although he had an only half-emptied tumbler in
      front of him. Presently he stumbled out on to the deck. It was a dark
      night, and a strong head wind was blowing. He groped his way to the
      railing and leaned over, with his head half buried in his hands. Below,
      the black tossing sea was churned into phosphorescent spray, as the
      steamer drove onwards into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it he indeed&mdash;George Richardson? He doubted it. The world of tape
      measures and calico counters seemed so far away; the interior of his
      quondam lodgings in a by-street of Islington, so unfamiliar and
      impossible. He felt himself swallowed up in this new and bewildering
      existence, of which he was so insignificant an atom, the existence where
      tragedy reared her gloomy head, and the shadows of great things loomed
      around him. Down there in the cold restless waste of black waters&mdash;what
      was it that he saw? The sweat broke out upon his forehead, the blood
      seemed turned to ice in his veins. He knew very well that his fancy mocked
      him, that it was not indeed a man&rsquo;s white face gleaming on the crest of
      the waves. But none the less he was terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richardson was certainly nervous. Not all the brandy he had drunk&mdash;and
      he had never drunk half as much before in his life&mdash;afforded him the
      least protection from these ghastly fancies. The step of a sailor on the
      deck made him shiver; the thought of his empty state room was a horror. He
      tried to think of the woman at whose bidding he had left behind him
      Islington and the things that belonged to Islington! He tried to recall
      her soft suggestive whispers, the glances which promised more even than
      her spoken words, all the perfume and mystery of her wonderful presence.
      Her very name was an allurement. Mademoiselle Violet! How softly it fell
      from the lips!... God in heaven, what was that? He started round,
      trembling in every limb. It was nothing more than the closing of the
      smoking room door behind him. Sailors with buckets and mops were already
      beginning their nightly tasks. He must go to his state room! Somehow or
      other, he must get through the night...
    </p>
    <p>
      He did it, but he was not a very prepossessing looking object when he
      staggered out on deck twelve hours later, into the noon sunshine. The
      chair towards which he looked so eagerly was occupied. He scarcely knew
      himself whether that little gulp of acute feeling, which shot through his
      veins, was of relief or disappointment. While he hesitated, Wingrave
      raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave did not, as a rule, speak to his fellow passengers. Of
      Richardson, he had not hitherto taken the slightest notice. Yet this
      morning, of all others, he addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said, holding it out towards him, &ldquo;that this envelope is
      yours. I found it under your chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richardson muttered something inarticulate, and almost snatched it away.
      It was the envelope of the fatal letter which Mademoiselle Violet had
      written him to Queenstown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Richardson, if you are not in a hurry,&rdquo; Wingrave continued
      calmly. &ldquo;I was hoping that I might see you this morning. Can you spare me
      a few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richardson subsided into his chair. His heart was thumping against his
      ribs. Wingrave&rsquo;s voice sounded to him like a far-off thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The handwriting upon that envelope which I have just restored to you, Mr.
      Richardson, is well known to me,&rdquo; Wingrave continued, gazing steadfastly
      at the young man whom he was addressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The envelope! The handwriting!&rdquo; Richardson faltered. &ldquo;I&mdash;it was from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An instant&rsquo;s pause. Wingrave raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We need not mention the lady&rsquo;s name. That she should be a
      correspondent of yours, however, helps me to understand better several
      matters which have somewhat puzzled me lately. No! Don&rsquo;t go, my dear sir.
      We must really have this affair straightened out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What affair?&rdquo; Richardson demanded, with a very weak attempt at bluster.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you&mdash;don&rsquo;t understand you at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave leaned a little forward in his chair. His eyebrows were drawn
      close together; his gaze was entirely merciless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not well this morning,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;A little headache perhaps!
      Won&rsquo;t you try one of these phenacetine lozenges&mdash;excellent things for
      a headache, I believe? Warranted, in fact, to cure all bodily ailments for
      ever! What! You don&rsquo;t like the look of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man cowered back in his chair. He was gripping the sides tightly
      with both hands, and the pallor of a ghastly fear had spread over his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a headache!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked thoughtfully at the box between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you took one of these, Mr. Richardson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you would never have
      another, at any rate. Now, tell me, sir, how you came by them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about&mdash;&rdquo; the young man began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me, sir,&rdquo; Wingrave said sharply. &ldquo;I have been wondering what
      the &mdash;&mdash; you meant by hanging around after me, giving the deck
      steward five shillings to put your chair next mine, and pretending to
      read, while all the time you were trying to overhear any scraps of
      conversation between my secretary and myself. I thought you were simply
      guilty of impertinent curiosity. This, however, rather alters the look of
      affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does?&rdquo; Richardson asked faintly. &ldquo;That box ain&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Wingrave answered, &ldquo;but you found it in my state room and
      filled it up with its present contents. My servant saw you coming out, and
      immediately went in to see what you had stolen, and report you. He found
      nothing missing, but he found this box full of lozenges, which he knows
      quite well was half full before you went in. Now, what was your object,
      Mr. Richardson, in tampering with that box upon my shelf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;I have never seen it before,&rdquo; Richardson declared. &ldquo;I have
      never been in your state room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deck steward was passing. Wingrave summoned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would ask my servant to step this way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will
      find him in my state room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man disappeared through the companion way. Richardson rose to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stay here to be bullied and cross examined,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;If you leave me now, I shall ask the captain
      to place you under arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richardson looked half fearfully around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attempted murder! Very clumsily attempted, but attempted murder none the
      less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man collapsed. Wingrave&rsquo;s servant came down the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sent for me, sir?&rdquo; he inquired respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave pointed towards his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that the person whom you saw coming out of my state room?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; the man replied at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could swear to him, if necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Morrison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man withdrew. Wingrave turned to his victim. &ldquo;A few weeks ago,&rdquo; he
      remarked, &ldquo;I had a visit from the lady whose handwriting is upon that
      envelope. I had on the table before me a box of phenacetine lozenges. She
      naturally concluded that I was in the habit of using them. That lady has
      unfortunately cause to consider me, if not an enemy, something very much
      like it. You are in correspondence with her. Only last night you placed in
      my box of these lozenges some others, closely resembling them, but
      fortunately a little different in shape. Mine were harmless&mdash;as a
      matter of fact, a single one of yours would kill a man in ten minutes.
      Now, Mr. Richardson, what have you to say about all this? Why should I not
      send for the captain, and have you locked up till we arrive at New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richardson drew his handkerchief across his damp forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove nothing,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that I must differ from you,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;We will see
      what the captain has to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward in his chair, to attract the attention of a seaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richardson interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said thickly. &ldquo;Suppose I own up! What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few questions&mdash;nothing terrifying. I am not very frightened of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you become acquainted with the writer of that letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richardson hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came to a dancing class at Islington,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave&rsquo;s face was expressionless, but his tone betrayed his incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dancing class at Islington! Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; the young man asserted, &ldquo;it was her mistress who put her up to
      this! It was nothing to do with her. It was for her mistress&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the mistress?&rdquo; Wingrave asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t know her name even. Never heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letter, then, was from the maid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it was,&rdquo; Richardson answered. &ldquo;If you recognize the writing,
      you must know that yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked reflectively seaward. The matter was not entirely clear to
      him. Yet he was sure that this young man was telling the truth, so far as
      he could divine it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have made your attempt and failed. If fortune had
      favored you, you might at this moment have been a murderer. I might have
      warned you, by the bye, that I am an exceedingly hard man to kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richardson looked uneasily around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t admitting anything, you know,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely! Well, what are you going to do now? Are you satisfied with
      your first reverse, or are you going to renew the experiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; was the dogged answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been made a fool of. I can
      see that. I shall return home by the next steamer. I never ought to have
      got mixed up in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am inclined to agree with you,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked calmly. &ldquo;Do I
      understand that if I choose to forget this little episode, you will return
      to England by the next steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; Richardson declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the meantime, that you make no further attempt of a similar
      nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; he answered with emphasis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Wingrave said, &ldquo;we need not prolong this conversation. Forgive my
      suggesting, Mr. Richardson, that whilst I am on deck, the other side of
      the ship should prove more convenient for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man rose, and without a word staggered off. Wingrave watched him
      through half-closed eyes, until he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was worth trying,&rdquo; he said softly to himself. &ldquo;A very clever woman
      that! She looks forward through the years, and she sees the clouds
      gathering. It was a little risky, and the means were very crude. But it
      was worth trying!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE MOTH AND THE CANDLE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked, &ldquo;we shall land.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be sorry,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth fidgeted about. He had something to say, and he found it
      difficult. Wingrave gave him no encouragement. He was leaning back in his
      steamer chair, with his eyes fixed upon the sky line. Notwithstanding the
      incessant companionship of the last six days, Aynesworth felt that he had
      not progressed a single step towards establishing any more intimate
      relations between his employer and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Travers is not on deck this afternoon,&rdquo; he remarked a trifle
      awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth sat down. There was nothing to be gained by fencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to talk about her, sir, if I might,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave withdrew his eyes from the sea, and looked at his companion in
      cold surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I thought, the first few days, that Mrs. Travers was simply a vain
      little woman of the world, perfectly capable of taking care of herself,
      and heartless enough to flirt all day long, if she chose, without any
      risk, so far as she was concerned. I believe I made a mistake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most interesting,&rdquo; Wingrave said calmly, &ldquo;but why talk to me
      about the lady? I fancy that I know as much about her as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; but you may not have realized the same things. Mrs. Travers
      is a married woman, with a husband in Boston, and two little children, of
      whom, I believe, she is really very fond. She is a foolish, good-natured
      little woman, who thinks herself clever because her husband has permitted
      her to travel a good deal, and has evidently been rather fascinated by the
      latitudinarianism of continental society. She is a little afraid of being
      terribly bored when she gets back to Boston, and she is very sentimental.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;that you had been submitting the lady
      and her affairs to the ordeal of your marvelous gift of analysis. I rather
      fancied that you took no interest in her at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;until last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And last night?&rdquo; he repeated questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found her on deck&mdash;crying. She had been tearing up some
      photographs, and she talked a little wildly. I talked to her then for a
      little time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you be more explicit?&rdquo; Wingrave asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth looked him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave me the impression,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that she did not intend to return
      to her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you to say to me about this?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to say anything, of course,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;You
      might very properly tell me that it is no concern of mine. Mrs. Travers
      has already compromised herself, to some extent, with the people on board
      who know her and her family. She never leaves your side for a moment if
      she can help it, and for the last two or three days she has almost
      followed you about. You may possibly derive some amusement from her
      society for a short time, but&mdash;afterwards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself exactly,&rdquo; Wingrave said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it necessary?&rdquo; Aynesworth declared brusquely. &ldquo;Talk sensibly to her!
      Don&rsquo;t encourage her if she should really be contemplating anything
      foolish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it all!&rdquo; Aynesworth declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a moralist, but she&rsquo;s a
      decent little woman. Don&rsquo;t ruin her life for the sake of a little
      diversion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave, who had been holding a cigar case in his hand for the last few
      minutes, opened it, and calmly selected a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little melodramatic, Aynesworth?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like it, no doubt,&rdquo; his companion answered, &ldquo;but after all, hang
      it, she&rsquo;s not a bad little sort, and you wouldn&rsquo;t care to meet her in
      Piccadilly in a couple of years&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave turned a little in his chair. There was a slight hardening of the
      mouth, a cold gleam in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;is precisely where you are wrong. I am afraid you
      have forgotten our previous conversations on this or a similar subject.
      Disconnect me in your mind at once from all philanthropic notions! I
      desire to make no one happy, to assist at no one&rsquo;s happiness. My own life
      has been ruined by a woman. Her sex shall pay me where it can. If I can
      obtain from the lady in question a single second&rsquo;s amusement, her future
      is a matter of entire indifference to me. She can play the repentant wife,
      or resort to the primeval profession of her sex. I should not even have
      the curiosity to inquire which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Aynesworth said slowly, &ldquo;I presume that I need say no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless it amuses you,&rdquo; Wingrave answered, &ldquo;it really is not worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked, &ldquo;it is as well that I should tell you
      this. I shall put the situation before Mrs. Travers exactly as I see it. I
      shall do my best to dissuade her from any further or more intimate
      intercourse with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the risk, of course,&rdquo; Wingrave said, &ldquo;of my offering you&mdash;this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a paper from his pocket book, and held it out. It was the return
      half of a steamer ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even at that risk,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave carefully folded the document, and returned it to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to find that you are so consistent. There is Mrs.
      Travers scolding the deck steward. Go and talk to her! You will scarcely
      find a better opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth rose at once. Wingrave in a few moments also left his seat, but
      proceeded in the opposite direction. He made his way into the purser&rsquo;s
      room, and carefully closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Travers greeted Aynesworth without enthusiasm. Her eyes were resting
      upon the empty place which Wingrave had just vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I get your chair for you, Mrs. Travers,&rdquo; Aynesworth asked, &ldquo;or shall
      we walk for a few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Travers hesitated. She looked around, but there was obviously no
      escape for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to sit down,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am very tired this morning. My
      chair is next Mr. Wingrave&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth found her rug and wrapped it around her. She leaned back and
      closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try to sleep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had such a shocking night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood at once that she was on her guard, and he changed his
      tactics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may I ask you a question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes wide, and looked at him. She was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;This afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon I may not have the opportunity,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Is your
      husband going to meet you at New York, Mrs. Travers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going direct to Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him steadily. There was a slight flush of color in her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find your questions impertinent, Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence. Aynesworth hated his task and hated himself.
      But most of all, he pitied the woman who sat by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are not impertinent. I am the looker-on, you know,
      and I have seen&mdash;a good deal. If Wingrave were an ordinary sort of
      man, I should never have dared to interfere. If you had been an ordinary
      sort of woman, I might not have cared to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She half rose in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not stay here,&rdquo; she began, struggling with her rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I am&mdash;I want to be your friend, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are supposed to be his,&rdquo; she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his secretary. There is no question of friendship between us. For
      the rest, I told him that I should speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to discuss me at all,&rdquo; she declared vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I have to rely entirely upon your mercy.
      This is the truth. People are thrown together a good deal on a voyage like
      this. You and Mr. Wingrave have seen a good deal of one another. You are a
      very impressionable woman; he is a singularly cold, unimpressionable man.
      You have found his personality attractive. You fancy&mdash;other things.
      Wingrave is not the man you think he is. He is selfish and entirely
      without affectionate impulses. The world has treated him badly, and he has
      no hesitation in saying that he means to get some part of his own back
      again. He does not care for you, he does not care for anyone. If you
      should be contemplating anything ridiculous from a mistaken judgment of
      his character, it is better that you should know the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The anger had gone. She was pale again, and her lips were trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men seldom know one another,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You judge from the
      surface only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is the critical judgment of one who has studied him intimately,&rdquo;
       Aynesworth said. &ldquo;Yours is the sentimental hope of one fascinated by what
      she does not understand. Wingrave is utterly heartless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she answered steadfastly, &ldquo;I do not believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not because you will not,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I have spoken because I
      wish to save you from doing what you would repent of for the rest of your
      days. You have the one vanity which is common to all women. You believe
      that you can change what, believe me, is unchangeable. To Wingrave, women
      are less than playthings. He owes the unhappiness of his life to one, and
      he would see the whole of her sex suffer without emotion. He is
      impregnable to sentiment. Ask him and I believe that he would admit it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and regarded him with the mild pity of superior knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand Mr. Wingrave,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth sighed. He realized that every word he had spoken had been
      wasted upon this pale, pretty woman, who sat with her eyes now turned
      seawards, and the smile still lingering upon her lips. Studying her for a
      moment, he realized the danger more acutely than ever before. The
      fretfulness seemed to have gone from her face, the weary lines from her
      mouth. She had the look of a woman who has come into the knowledge of
      better things. And it was Wingrave who had done this! Aynesworth for the
      first time frankly hated the man. Once, as a boy, he had seen a keeper
      take a rabbit from a trap and dash its brains out against a tree. The
      incident flashed then into his mind, only the face of the keeper was the
      face of Wingrave!

    <h2>
      &ldquo;DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Wingrave and Aynesworth were alone in a private room of the Waldorf
      Astoria Hotel. The table at which the former was seated was covered with
      letters and papers. A New York directory and an atlas were at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose,&rdquo; Wingrave said, leaning back in his chair, &ldquo;to give you some
      idea of the nature of my business in this country. You will be able then,
      I trust, to carry out my instructions more intelligibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you came here simply to remain in seclusion
      for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one of my reasons,&rdquo; Wingrave admitted, &ldquo;but I had a special
      purpose in coming to America. During my&mdash;enforced seclusion&mdash;I
      made the acquaintance of a man called Hardwell. He was an Englishman, but
      he had lived in America for some years, and had got into trouble over some
      company business. We had some conversation, and it is upon his information
      that I am now going to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is trustworthy?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take the risk,&rdquo; Wingrave answered coolly. &ldquo;There is a small copper mine
      in Utah called the Royal Hardwell Copper Mine. The shares are hundred
      dollar ones, and there are ten thousand of them. They are scarcely quoted
      now, as the mine has become utterly discredited. Hardwell managed this
      himself with a false report. He meant to have the company go into
      liquidation, and then buy it for a very small amount. As a matter of fact,
      the mine is good, and could be worked at a large profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have Hardwell&rsquo;s word for that,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Wingrave remarked. &ldquo;I am proceeding on the assumption that he
      told me the truth. I wish to buy, if possible, the whole of the shares,
      and as many more as I can get brokers to sell. The price of the shares
      today is two dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume you will send out an expert to the mine first?&rdquo; Aynesworth
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;The fact that I was
      buying upon information would send the shares up at once. I mean to buy
      first, and then go out to the mine. If I have made a mistake, I shall not
      be ruined. If Hardwell&rsquo;s story is true, there will be millions in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth said nothing, but his face expressed a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the names of seven respectable brokers,&rdquo; Wingrave continued,
      passing a sheet of paper towards him. &ldquo;I want you to buy five hundred
      shares from each of them. The price may vary a few points. Whatever it is,
      pay it. Here are seven signed checks. I shall buy myself as many as I can
      without spoiling the market. You had better start out in about a quarter
      of an hour and see to this. You have my private ledger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open an account to Hardwell in it; a quarter of all the shares I buy are
      to be in his name, and a quarter of all the profits I make in dealing in
      the shares is to be credited to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fairly generous arrangement for Mr. Hardwell,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing generous about it,&rdquo; Wingrave answered coldly. &ldquo;It is the
      arrangement I made with him, and to which I propose to adhere. You
      understand what I want you to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered; &ldquo;I still think, however, that much the
      wiser course would be to send an expert to the mine first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Wingrave remarked politely. &ldquo;That is all, I think. I shall
      expect to see you at luncheon time. If you are asked questions as to why
      you are dealing in these shares to such an extent, you can say that the
      friend for whom you are acting desires to boom copper, and is going on the
      low price of the metal at the moment. They will think you a fool, and
      perhaps may not trouble to conceal their opinion after they have finished
      the business. You must endeavor to support the character. I have no doubt
      but that you will be successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Wingrave called him back. He was leaning a little forward across
      the table. His face was very set and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a question which I wish to ask you, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
      concerns another matter altogether. Do you know who sent the Marconigram
      to Dr. Travers, which brought him to New York to meet his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was sent by someone on board the ship,&rdquo; Wingrave continued. &ldquo;You have
      no suspicion as to whom it could have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None!&rdquo; Aynesworth answered firmly. &ldquo;At the same time, I do not mind
      telling you this. If I had thought of it, I would have sent it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perhaps fortunate for the continuation of our mutual relations that
      you did not think of it,&rdquo; he remarked quietly. &ldquo;I accept your denial. I
      shall expect you back at one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a few minutes after that hour the two men sat down to luncheon.
      Wingrave at that time was the possessor of six thousand shares in the
      Royal Hardwell Copper Mine, which had cost him, on an average, two dollars
      twenty-five. The news of the dealing, however, had got about, and although
      derision was the chief sentiment amongst the brokers, the price steadily
      mounted. A dozen telegrams were sent out to the mine, and on receipt of
      the replies, the dealing became the joke of the day. The mine was still
      deserted, and no fresh inspection had been made. The price dropped a
      little. Then Wingrave bought a thousand more by telephone, and it rose
      again to four. A few minutes before closing time, he threw every share of
      which he was possessed upon the market, and the next morning Royal
      Hardwells stood at one dollar seventy-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week Wingrave pursued the same tactics, and at the end of that time
      he had made twenty thousand dollars. The brokers, however, now understood,
      or thought they understood, the situation. No one bought for the rise;
      they were all sellers. Wingrave at once changed his tactics. He bought
      five thousand shares in one block, and sold none. Even then, the market
      was only mildly amused. In a fortnight he was the nominal owner of sixteen
      thousand shares in a company of which only ten thousand actually existed.
      Then he sat still, and the panic began. The shares in a company which
      everyone believed to be worthless stood at thirty dollars, and not a share
      was offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small pandemonium reigned in Wingrave&rsquo;s sitting room. The telephone rang
      all the time; the place was besieged with brokers. Then Wingrave showed
      his hand. He had bought these shares to hold; he did not intend to sell
      one. As to the six thousand owed to him beyond the number issued, he was
      prepared to consider offers. One broker left him a check for twenty
      thousand dollars, another for nearly forty thousand. Wingrave had no pity.
      He had gambled and won. He would accept nothing less than par price. The
      air in his sitting room grew thick with curses and tobacco smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth began by hating the whole business, but insensibly the
      fascination of it crept over him. He grew used to hearing the various
      forms of protest, of argument and abuse, which one and all left Wingrave
      so unmoved. Sphinx-like he lounged in his chair, and listened to all. He
      never condescended to justify his position, he never met argument by
      argument. He had the air of being thoroughly bored by the whole
      proceedings. But he exacted always his pound of flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third afternoon, Aynesworth met on the stairs a young broker, whom
      he had come across once or twice during his earlier dealings in the
      shares. They had had lunch together, and Aynesworth had taken a fancy to
      the boy&mdash;he was little more&mdash;fresh from Harvard and full of
      enthusiasm. He scarcely recognized him for a moment. The fresh color had
      gone from his cheeks, his eyes were set in a fixed, wild stare; he seemed
      suddenly aged. Aynesworth stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Nesbitt!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man would have passed on with a muttered greeting, but
      Aynesworth turned round with him, and led the way into one of the smaller
      smoking rooms. He called for drinks and repeated his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your governor has me six hundred Hardwells short,&rdquo; Nesbitt answered
      curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six hundred! What does it mean?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixty thousand dollars, or thereabouts,&rdquo; the young man answered
      despairingly. &ldquo;His brokers won&rsquo;t listen to me, and your governor&mdash;well,
      I&rsquo;ve just been to see him. I won&rsquo;t call him names! And we thought that
      some fool of an Englishman was burning his fingers with those shares. I&rsquo;m
      not the only one caught, but the others can stand it. I can&rsquo;t, worse
      luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beastly sorry,&rdquo; Aynesworth said truthfully. &ldquo;I wish I could help
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt raised his head. A sudden light flashed in his eyes; he spoke
      quickly, almost feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do you think you could do anything with
      your governor for me? You see&mdash;it&rsquo;s ruin if I have to pay up. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;for myself, but I was married four months ago, and I
      can&rsquo;t bear the thought of going home&mdash;and telling her. All the money
      we have between us is in my business, and we&rsquo;ve got no rich friends or
      anything of that sort. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do if I have to be hammered.
      I&rsquo;ve been so careful, too! I didn&rsquo;t want to take this on, but it seemed
      such a soft thing! If I could get off with twenty thousand, I&rsquo;d keep my
      head up. I hate to talk like this. I&rsquo;d go down like a man if I were alone,
      but&mdash;but&mdash;oh! Confound it all&mdash;!&rdquo; he exclaimed with an
      ominous break in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth laid his hand upon the boy&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try what I can do with Mr. Wingrave. Wait
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth found his employer alone with his broker, who was just
      hastening off to keep an appointment. He plunged at once into his appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have just had a young broker named Nesbitt
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave glanced at a paper by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Six hundred short! I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to him downstairs,&rdquo; Aynesworth said. &ldquo;This will break
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I ought not to have done business with him at all,&rdquo; Wingrave said
      coolly. &ldquo;If he cannot find sixty thousand dollars, he has no right to be
      in Wall street. I daresay he&rsquo;ll pay, though! They all plead poverty&mdash;curs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Nesbitt&rsquo;s case is a little different from the others,&rdquo; Aynesworth
      continued. &ldquo;He is quite young, little more than a boy, and he has only
      just started in business. To be hammered would be absolute ruin for him.
      He seems such a decent young fellow, and he&rsquo;s only just married. He&rsquo;s in
      an awful state downstairs. I wish you&rsquo;d have another talk with him. I
      think you&rsquo;d feel inclined to let him down easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave smiled coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you astonish me. I am not interested in
      this young man&rsquo;s future or in his matrimonial arrangements. He has gambled
      with me and lost. I presume that he would have taken my money if I had
      been the fool they all thought me. As it is, I mean to have his&mdash;down
      to the last cent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t like the others,&rdquo; Aynesworth protested doggedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a
      boy&mdash;and it seems such jolly hard luck, doesn&rsquo;t it, only four months
      married! New York hasn&rsquo;t much pity for paupers. He looks mad enough to
      blow his brains out. Have him up, sir, and see if you can&rsquo;t compromise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch him,&rdquo; Wingrave said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth hurried downstairs. The boy was walking restlessly up and down
      the room. The look he turned upon Aynesworth was almost pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see you again,&rdquo; Aynesworth said hurriedly. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy wrung his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>

    <h2>
      THE HIDDEN HAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wingrave glanced up as they entered. He motioned Nesbitt to a chair by his
      side, but the young man remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My secretary tells me,&rdquo; Wingrave said curtly, &ldquo;that you cannot pay me
      what you owe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than I possess in the world, sir,&rdquo; Nesbitt answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a large amount,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;I do not see how you can carry
      on business unless you can command such a sum as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt moistened his dry lips with his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only been doing a very small business, sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but
      quite enough to make a living. I don&rsquo;t speculate as a rule. Hardwells
      seemed perfectly safe, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have touched them. I sold at four.
      They are not worth one. I could have bought thousands last week for two
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is beside the question,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;If you do not pay this,
      you have cheated me out of my profits for I should have placed the
      commission with brokers who could. Why did you wish to see me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you might give me time,&rdquo; Nesbitt answered, raising his
      head and looking Wingrave straight in the face. &ldquo;It seems rather a low
      down thing to come begging. I&rsquo;d rather cut my right hand off than do it
      for myself, but I&rsquo;ve&mdash;someone else to think about, and if I&rsquo;m
      hammered, I&rsquo;m done for. Give me a chance, Mr. Wingrave! I&rsquo;ll pay you in
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you ask for?&rdquo; Wingrave said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you might give me time,&rdquo; Nesbitt said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll pay you
      the rest off with the whole of my profits every year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most absurd proposal,&rdquo; Wingrave said coolly. &ldquo;I will instruct my
      brokers to take twenty thousand dollars down, and wait one week for the
      balance. That is the best offer I can make you. Good day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man stood as though he were stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t find it,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your resources are not my affair,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;I shall instruct my
      broker to do as I have said. If the money is not forthcoming, you know the
      alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to ruin me, then?&rdquo; Nesbitt said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to exact the payment of what is due to me,&rdquo; Wingrave said curtly.
      &ldquo;If you cannot pay, it seems to me that I am the person to be pitied&mdash;not
      you. Show Mr. Nesbitt out, Aynesworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt turned towards the door. He was very pale, but he walked steadily.
      He did not speak another word to Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beastly sorry,&rdquo; Aynesworth said to him on the stairs. &ldquo;I wish I could
      help you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Nesbitt answered. &ldquo;No one can help me. I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth returned to the sitting room. Wingrave had lit a cigarette and
      watched him as he arranged some papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a comedy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he remarked grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t present itself in that light to me,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave blew the smoke away from in front of his face. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      forgot that you were a sentimentalist. I look upon these things from my
      own point of view. From yours, I suppose I must seem a very disagreeable
      person. I admit frankly that the sufferings of other people do not affect
      me in the slightest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for you,&rdquo; Aynesworth said shortly. &ldquo;If there is going to be
      much of this sort of thing, though, I must ask you to relieve me of my
      post. I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you like, my dear fellow,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I think that you
      would be very foolish to leave me, though. I must be a most interesting
      study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are&mdash;what the devil made you!&rdquo; Aynesworth muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave laid down his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am what my fellows have made me,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I tasted hell for a
      good many years. It has left me, I suppose, with a depraved taste. Ring up
      my brokers, Aynesworth! I want to speak to Malcolmson. He had better come
      round here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day dragged on. Aynesworth hated it all, and was weary long before it
      was half over. Everyone who came was angry, and a good many came whom
      Wingrave refused to see. Just before five o&rsquo;clock, young Nesbitt entered
      the room unannounced. Aynesworth started towards him with a little
      exclamation. The young man&rsquo;s evident excitement terrified him, and he
      feared a tragedy. Malcolmson, too, half rose to his feet. Wingrave alone
      remained unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt walked straight up to the table at which Malcolmson and Wingrave
      were sitting. He halted in front of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will give me my receipt for those shares for
      fifty-seven thousand six hundred dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave turned to a paper by his side, and ran his forefinger down the
      list of names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Nesbitt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes! sixty thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man laid a slip of paper upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a certified check for the amount,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Malcolmson,
      please give me my receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Mr. Wingrave remarked. &ldquo;I thought that you would find the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt bit his lip, but he said nothing till he had the receipt and had
      fastened it up in his pocket. Then he turned suddenly round upon Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your money. I don&rsquo;t owe you a cent. Now
      I&rsquo;m going to tell you what I think of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave rose slowly to his feet. He was as tall as the boy, long, lean,
      and hard. His face expressed neither anger nor excitement, but there was a
      slight, dangerous glitter in his deep-set eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are going to be impertinent, I would
      recommend you to change your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt for a moment hesitated. There was something ominous in the cool
      courage of the older man. And before he could collect himself, Wingrave
      continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you chose your own profession. You knew quite
      well there was no place in it for men with a sense of the higher morality.
      It is a profession of gamblers and thieves. If you&rsquo;d won, you&rsquo;d have
      thought yourself a smart fellow and pocketed your winnings fast enough.
      Now that you&rsquo;ve lost&mdash;don&rsquo;t whine. You sat down willingly enough to
      play the game with me. Don&rsquo;t call me names because you lost. This is no
      place for children. Pocket your defeat, and be more careful next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt was silent for a moment. Wingrave, cool and immovable, dominated
      him. He gave a little laugh, and turned towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll let it go at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth followed him from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad you&rsquo;re out of the scrape,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right along,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a drink in the daytime for a
      year, but we&rsquo;re going to have a big one now. I say, do you know how I got
      that money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On easy terms, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down in the American Bar, and a colored waiter in a white linen
      suit brought them whisky and Apollinaris in tall tumblers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Nesbitt said. &ldquo;My brain is on the reel still. I went back to my
      office, and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the little girl, I should have brought a
      revolver by the way. Old Johnny there waiting to see me, no end of a
      swell, Phillson, the uptown lawyer. He went straight for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Been dealing in Hardwells?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Short, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Six hundred shares,&rsquo; I answered. There was no harm in telling him for
      the Street knew well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bad job,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;How much does Wingrave want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Shares at par,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;It comes to close on fifty-seven thousand
      six hundred dollars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to find you the money,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can tell you the things in my office began to swim. I&rsquo;d an idea
      somehow that he was there as a friend, but nothing like this. I couldn&rsquo;t
      answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a delicate piece of business,&rsquo; he went on. &lsquo;In fact, the fewer
      questions you ask the better. All I can say is there&rsquo;s a chap in Wall
      Street got his eye on you. Your old dad once helped him over a much worse
      place than this. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve a check here for sixty thousand dollars, and
      no conditions, only that you don&rsquo;t talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But when am I to pay it back?&rsquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If my client ever needs it, and you can afford it, he will ask for it.&rsquo; 
      Phillson answered. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And before I could say another darned word, he was gone, and the check
      was there on my desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth sipped his whisky and Apollinaris, and lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they say,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;that romance does not exist in Wall Street.
      You&rsquo;re a lucky chap, Nesbitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky! Do you think I don&rsquo;t realize it? Of course, I know the old
      governor had lots of friends on the Street, but he was never in a big way,
      and he got hit awfully hard himself before he died. I can&rsquo;t understand it
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked, laughing. &ldquo;By the bye, your friend,
      whoever he was, must have got to know pretty quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course, Phillsons are lawyers for
      Malcolmson, Wingrave&rsquo;s broker, so I daresay it came from him. Say,
      Aynesworth, you don&rsquo;t mind if I ask you something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the devil do you stop with a man like Wingrave? He doesn&rsquo;t seem your
      sort at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave interests me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;He has had a curious life, and he
      is a man with very strange ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt finished his drink, and rose up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not a man I should care to be associated with. Not
      but what I daresay he was right upstairs. He&rsquo;s strong, too, and he must
      have a nerve. But he&rsquo;s a brute for all that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nesbitt went his way, and Aynesworth returned upstairs. Wingrave was
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we finished this miserable business?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the present,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;Mr. Malcolmson will supply you with
      a copy of the accounts. See that Hardwell is credited with a quarter share
      of the profits. Our dealings are over for the present. Be prepared to
      start on Saturday for the West. We are going to look for those bears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the mine?&rdquo; Aynesworth exclaimed. &ldquo;It belongs to you now. Aren&rsquo;t you
      going out to examine it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know nothing about mines. My visit could not teach me
      anything one way or the other. I have sent a commission of experts. I am
      tired of cities and money-making. I want a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth looked at him suddenly. The weariness was there indeed&mdash;was
      it his fancy, or was it something more than weariness which shone out of
      the dark, tired eyes?

    <h2>
      &ldquo;MR. WINGRAVE FROM AMERICA&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four years ago tonight,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, looking round the club smoking
      room thoughtfully, &ldquo;we bade you farewell in this same room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell, wan and hollow-eyed, his arm in a sling, his once burly frame
      gaunt and attenuated with disease, nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I told you the story,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;of&mdash;the man who had been my
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk of Wingrave tonight!&rdquo; Aynesworth exclaimed with sudden
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Lovell knocked the ashes from his pipe, and commenced leisurely
      to refill it. &ldquo;Why not, indeed? I mean to go and see him as soon as I can
      get about a little better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your description of him,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, &ldquo;was a faithful one, you
      will find him changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell laughed a little bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The years leave their mark,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;upon us all&mdash;upon all of us,
      that is, who step out into the open where the winds of life are blowing.
      Look at me! I weighed eighteen stone when I left England. I had the
      muscles of a prize fighter and nerves of steel. Today I turn the scale at
      ten stone and am afraid to be alone in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be yourself again in no time,&rdquo; Aynesworth declared cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be better than I am now, I hope,&rdquo; Lovell answered, &ldquo;but I shall
      never be the man I was. I have seen&mdash;God grant that I may some day
      forget what I have seen! No wonder that my nerves have gone! I saw a
      Russian correspondent, a strong brutal-looking man, go off into hysterics;
      I saw another run amuck through the camp, shooting right and left, and,
      finally, blow his own brains out. Many a night I sobbed myself to sleep.
      The men who live through tragedies, Aynesworth, age fast. I expect that I
      shall find Wingrave changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give a good deal,&rdquo; Aynesworth declared, &ldquo;to have known him when
      you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should be able to judge of the past,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by the present. Four
      years of&mdash;intimate companionship with any man should be enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; Aynesworth declared. &ldquo;And yet I can assure you that I know no
      more of Wingrave today than when I was first attracted to him by your
      story and became his secretary. It is a humiliating confession, but it is
      the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why you remain with him,&rdquo; Lovell remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so! I have often meant to leave, but somehow, when the time
      comes, I stay on. His life seems to be made up of brutalities, small and
      large. He ruins a man with as little compunction as one could fancy him,
      in his younger days, pulling the legs from a fly. I have never seen him do
      a kindly action. And yet, all the time I find myself watching for it. A
      situation arises, and I say to myself: &lsquo;Now I am going to see something
      different.&rsquo; I never do, and yet I always expect it. Am I boring you,
      Lovell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least! Go on! Anything concerning Wingrave interests me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is four years ago, you know, since I went to him. My first glimpse of
      his character was the cold brutality with which he treated Lady Ruth when
      she went to see him. Then we went down to his country place in Cornwall.
      There was a small child there, whose father had been the organist of the
      village, and who had died penniless. There was no one to look after her,
      no one to save her from the charity schools and domestic service
      afterwards. The church was on Wingrave&rsquo;s estate, it should have been his
      duty to augment the ridiculous salary the dead man had received. Would you
      believe it, Wingrave refused to do a single thing for that child! He went
      down there like a vandal to sell the heirlooms and pictures which had
      belonged to his family for generations. He had no time, he told me coldly,
      for sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds brutal enough,&rdquo; Lovell admitted. &ldquo;What became of the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of her father&rsquo;s relations turned up after all and took care of her,&rdquo;
       Aynesworth said. &ldquo;Wingrave knew nothing about that, though. Then on the
      voyage across the Atlantic, there was a silly, pretty little woman on
      board who was piqued by Wingrave&rsquo;s indifference and tried to flirt with
      him. In a few days she was his slave. She was going home to her husband,
      and you would have thought that any decent fellow would have told her that
      she was a little fool, and let her go. But not Wingrave! She was landing
      with him at New York, but someone amongst the passengers, who guessed what
      was up, sent a Marconigram to her husband, and he met us at the landing
      stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing came of that, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but it wasn&rsquo;t Wingrave&rsquo;s fault. Then he began dealing with some
      shares in a mine&mdash;THE mine, you know. They were supposed to be
      worthless, and one boy, who was a little young to the game, sold him too
      many. Wingrave was bleeding these brokers for hundreds of thousands of
      dollars, and the boy came and asked to be let off by paying his whole
      fortune to escape being hammered. Wingrave refused. I believe if the boy
      hadn&rsquo;t just been married, he&rsquo;d have blown his brains out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t envy you your job,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Is there nothing to set down on
      the credit side of the ledger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;He is a fine sportsman, and he saved my
      life in the Rockies, which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes. He
      has a sense of justice, for he heard of this mine from a man in prison,
      and he has kept accounts showing the fellow&rsquo;s share down to the last
      halfpenny. But I have never yet known him to speak a kindly word or do a
      kindly deed. He seems intent upon carrying out to the letter his own
      principles&mdash;to make as many people as possible suffer for his own
      broken life. Now he is back here, a millionaire, with immense power for
      good or for evil, I am almost afraid of him. I wouldn&rsquo;t be Lady Ruth or
      her husband for something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell smoked thoughtfully for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave was always a little odd,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but I never thought that
      he was a bad chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see him now!&rdquo; Aynesworth said. &ldquo;Tell me if you think he wears a
      mask or whether he is indeed what he seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hall porter entered the room and addressed Aynesworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentleman called for you, sir,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Wingrave,&rdquo; Aynesworth declared. &ldquo;Come and speak to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended the stairs together. Outside, Wingrave was leaning back in
      the corner of an electric brougham, reading the paper. Aynesworth put his
      head in at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember Lovell, Mr. Wingrave?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We were just talking when
      your message came up. I&rsquo;ve brought him down to shake hands with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave folded his paper down at the precise place where he had been
      reading and extended a very limp hand. His manner betrayed not the
      slightest interest or pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Lovell?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Some time since we met!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many years,&rdquo; Lovell answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finished your campaigning?&rdquo; Wingrave inquired. &ldquo;Knocked you about a bit,
      haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They very nearly finished me,&rdquo; Lovell admitted. &ldquo;I shall pick up all
      right over here, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Lovell&rsquo;s thoughts had flashed backwards
      through the years, back to the time when he had sat within a few feet of
      this man in the crowded court of justice and listened through the painful
      stillness of that heavy atmosphere, charged with tragedy, to the slow
      unfolding of the drama of his life. There had been passion enough then in
      his voice and blazing in his eyes, emotion enough in his twitching
      features and restless gestures to speak of the fire below. And now, pale
      and cold, the man who had gripped his fingers then and held on to them
      like a vise, seemed to find nothing except a slight boredom in this
      unexpected meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see you again, I hope,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked at last. &ldquo;By the bye,
      if we do meet, I should be glad if you would forget our past acquaintance.
      Sir Wingrave Seton does not exist any longer. I prefer to be known only as
      Mr. Wingrave from America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you wish, of course,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that
      you need fear recognition. I myself should have passed you in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave leaned back in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you are ready, will you get in and tell the man
      to drive to Cadogan Square? Good night, Mr. Lovell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lovell re-entered the club with a queer little smile at his lips. The
      brougham glided up into the Strand, and turned westwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going straight to the Barringtons&rsquo;?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;While I think of it, Aynesworth, I wish you to
      remember this. Both Lady Ruth and her husband seem to think it part of the
      game to try and make a cat&rsquo;s paw of you. I am not suggesting that they are
      likely to succeed, but I do think it possible that one of them may ask you
      questions concerning certain investments in which I am interested. I rely
      upon you to give them no information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know very little about your investments&mdash;outside the mine,&rdquo;
       Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t very well approach a more ignorant
      person. Are you going to help Barrington to make a fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave turned his head. There was a slight contraction of the forehead,
      an ominous glitter in his steel grey eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know that I am not likely to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men did not meet again till late in the evening. Lady Ruth&rsquo;s rooms
      were crowded for it was the beginning of the political season, and her
      parties were always popular. Nevertheless, she found time to beckon
      Wingrave to her before they had been in the room many minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk to you,&rdquo; she said a little abruptly. &ldquo;You might have come
      this afternoon as you promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth was a wonderful woman. A well-known statesman had just asked a
      friend her age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but whatever it is, she doesn&rsquo;t look it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tonight she was almost girlish. Her complexion was delicate and perfectly
      natural, the graceful lines of her figure suggested more the immaturity of
      youth than any undue slimness. She wore a wonderful collar of pearls
      around her long, shapely neck, but very little other jewelry. The touch of
      her fingers upon Wingrave&rsquo;s coat sleeve was a carefully calculated thing.
      If he had thought of it, he could have felt the slight appealing pressure
      with which she led him towards one of the smaller rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two chairs there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come and sit down. I have
      something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE SHADOW OF A FEAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      For several minutes Lady Ruth said nothing. She was leaning back in the
      farthest corner of her chair, her head resting slightly upon her fingers,
      her eyes studying with a curious intentness the outline of Wingrave&rsquo;s
      pale, hard face. He himself, either unconscious of, or indifferent to her
      close scrutiny, had simply the air of a man possessed of an inexhaustible
      fund of patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I think that the time has gone by when I
      was afraid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned slightly towards her, but he did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am possessed,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;at present, of a more womanly sentiment.
      I am curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you were always a little inclined that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am curious about you,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You are, comparatively speaking,
      young, well-looking enough, and strong. Your hand is firmly planted upon
      the lever which moves the world. What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;depends upon many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be ambitious,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;If so, you conceal it admirably.
      You may be devoting your powers to the consummation of vengeance against
      those who have treated you ill. There are no signs of that, either, at
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have excellent authority,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;for the statement that a
      considerable amount of satisfaction is derivable from the exercise of that
      sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but the pursuit of vengeance for wrongs of the
      past is the task of a fool. Now, you are not a fool. You carry your life
      locked up within you as a strong man should. But there are always some who
      may look in through the windows. I should like to be one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An empty cupboard,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;A cupboard swept bare by time and
      necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your life,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is molded towards a purpose. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask myself the question,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;before I can tell you the
      answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the necessity does not exist. Your reckless pursuit of
      wealth, your return here, the use you are making of my husband and me, are
      all means towards some end. Why not tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your imagination,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;is running away with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you our enemy?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is this seeming friendship of yours a
      cloak to hide some scheme of yours to make us suffer? Or&mdash;&rdquo; She drew
      a little closer to him, and her eyes drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a little left,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;of the old folly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he answered quietly. &ldquo;I was very much in love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dead,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I believe that you hate me now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was almost a caress. She was leaning a little towards him; her
      eyes were seeking to draw his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hate you! How impossible!&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;You are still a beautiful
      woman, you know, Ruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and studied her critically. Lady Ruth raised her eyes once, but
      dropped them at once. She felt herself growing paler. A spasm of the old
      fear was upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;age has not touched you. You can still pour, if you
      will, the magic drug into the wine of fools. By the bye, I must not be
      selfish. Aren&rsquo;t you rather neglecting your guests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my guests,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have been wanting to talk to you
      alone for days. Why have you done this? Why are you here? What is it that
      you are seeking for in life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little amusement only,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I cannot find it except amongst
      my own kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not the appearance of a pleasure seeker,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is a passive search,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have some years to live&mdash;and
      of solitude, well, I have tasted at once the joys and the depths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not in love with me any longer, are you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not bold enough to deny it,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but do not be afraid that
      I shall embarrass you with a declaration. To tell you the truth, I have
      not much feeling left of any sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to keep your own counsel, then?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so little to keep,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;and I have parted with so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She measured the emotion of his tone, the curious yet perfectly natural
      indifference of his manner, and she shivered a little. Always she feared
      what she could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped,&rdquo; she said sadly, &ldquo;that we might at least have been friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no fancy,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;for the cemeteries of affection. You must
      remember that I am beginning life anew. I do not know myself yet, or you!
      Let us drift into the knowledge of one another, and perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be no question of friendship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth went back to her guests, and with the effortless ease of long
      training, she became once more the gracious and tactful hostess. But in
      her heart, the fear had grown a little stronger, and a specter walked by
      her side. Once during the evening, her husband looked at her
      questioningly, and she breathed a few words to him. He laughed
      reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Wingrave&rsquo;s all right, I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only his manner that
      puts you off a bit. He&rsquo;s just the same with everyone! I don&rsquo;t think he
      means anything by it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth shivered, but she said nothing. Just then Aynesworth came up,
      and with a motion of her fan she called him to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take me into the other room,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;I want a glass of
      champagne, and on the way you can tell me all about America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is always making epigrams about America,&rdquo; he protested, smiling.
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you spare me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, then, how you progress with your great character study!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he remarked quietly, &ldquo;you come now to a more interesting subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly, I do not progress at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as you have gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I were to take pen and paper and write down, at this
      moment, my conclusions so far as I have been able to form any, I fancy
      that they would make evil reading. Permit me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood for a few minutes before the long sideboard. A footman had
      poured champagne into their glasses, and Lady Ruth talked easily enough
      the jargon of the moment. But when they turned away, she moved slowly, and
      her voice was almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is he really as hard and cold as he seems? You
      have lived with him now for four years. You should know that, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that he is,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I can tell you that much, at
      least, without breach of faith. So far as one who watches him can tell, he
      lives for his own gratification&mdash;and his indulgence in it does not,
      as a rule, make for the happiness of other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what does he want with us?&rdquo; she asked almost sharply. &ldquo;I ask myself
      that question until&mdash;I am terrified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very possible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he is simply making use of you to
      re-enter the world. Curiously enough, he has never seemed to care for
      solitude. He makes numberless acquaintances. What pleasure he finds in it
      I do not know, but he seldom avoids people. He may be simply making use of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;Indeed I cannot tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him a little impatiently, and Aynesworth joined the outside of
      the circle of men who had gathered round Wingrave. He was answering their
      questions readily enough, if a little laconically. He was quite aware that
      he occupied in society the one unique place to which princes might not
      even aspire&mdash;there was something of divinity about his millions,
      something of awe in the tone of the men with whom he talked. Women
      pretended to be interested in him because of the romance of his suddenly
      acquired wealth&mdash;the men did not trouble to deceive themselves or
      anyone else. A break up of the group came when a certain great and
      much-talked-about lady sent across an imperative message by her cavalier
      for the moment. She desired that Mr. Wingrave should be presented to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed down the room together a few moments later, the Marchioness
      wonderfully dressed in a gown of strange turquoise blue, looking up at her
      companion, and talking with somewhat unusual animation. Everyone made
      remarks, of course&mdash;exchanged significant glances and unlovely
      smiles. It was so like the Marchioness to claim, as a matter of course,
      the best of everything that was going. Lady Ruth watched them with a
      curious sense of irritation for which she could not altogether account. It
      was impossible that she should be jealous, and yet it was equally certain
      that she was annoyed. If Wingrave resisted his present fair captor, he
      would enjoy a notability equal to that which his wealth already conferred
      upon him. No man as yet had done it. Was it likely that Wingrave would
      wear two crowns? Lady Ruth beckoned Aynesworth to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what is Mr. Wingrave&rsquo;s general attitude towards my
      sex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolute indifference,&rdquo; he declared promptly, &ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go on,&rdquo; she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless he is possessed of the ability to make them suffer,&rdquo; he answered
      after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Emily will never attract him,&rdquo; she declared almost triumphantly,
      &ldquo;for she has no more heart that he has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has yet to discover it,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked. &ldquo;When he does, I think
      you will find that he will shrug his shoulders&mdash;and say farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Lady Ruth murmured to herself, &ldquo;Emily is a cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth spoke to one more man that night of Wingrave&mdash;and that man
      was her husband. Their guests had departed, and Lady Ruth, in a marvelous
      white dressing gown, was lying upon the sofa in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you get on with Wingrave?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What do you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can one think of a man,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;who goes about like an
      animated mummy? I have done my best; I talked to him for nearly half an
      hour at a stretch today when I took him to the club for lunch. He is the
      incarnation of indifference. He won&rsquo;t listen to politics; women, or tales
      about them, at any rate, seem to bore him to extinction; he drinks only as
      a matter of form, and he won&rsquo;t talk finance. By the bye, Ruth, I wish you
      could get him to give you a tip. I scarcely see how we are going to get
      through the season unless something turns up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it as bad as that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse!&rdquo; her husband answered gloomily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been living on our capital
      for years. Every acre of Queen&rsquo;s Norton is mortgaged, and I&rsquo;m shot if I
      can see how we&rsquo;re going to pay the interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed a little wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that it would be wise?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Let me tell you
      something, Lumley. I have only known what fear was once in my life. I am
      afraid now. I am afraid of Wingrave. I have a fancy that he does not mean
      any good to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington frowned and threw his cigarette into the fire with a little
      jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s not quite so bad as that. We&rsquo;ve been
      useful to him. We&rsquo;ve done exactly what he asked. The other matter&rsquo;s dead
      and buried. We don&rsquo;t want his money, but it is perfectly easy for him to
      help us make a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Lumley, that it is dangerous!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not the clever woman I take you for,&rdquo; he answered, turning to
      leave the room. &ldquo;Just as you please. Only it will be that or the
      bankruptcy court before long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth lay quite still, looking into the fire. When her maid came, she
      moved on tiptoe for it seemed to her that her mistress slept. But Lady
      Ruth was wide awake though the thoughts which were flitting through her
      brain had, perhaps, some kinship to the land of dreams.

    <h2>
      JULIET ASKS QUESTIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any place,&rdquo; the girl exclaimed as she entered, &ldquo;more unlike a solicitor&rsquo;s
      office, I never saw! Flowers outside and flowers on your desk, Mr.
      Pengarth! Don&rsquo;t you have to apologize to your clients for your
      surroundings? There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing, except the brass plate outside,
      to show that this isn&rsquo;t an old-fashioned farmhouse, stuck down in the
      middle of a village. Fuchsias in the window sill, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed a chair for her, and laid down the deed which he had been
      examining, with a little sigh of relief. It really was very hard work
      pretending to be busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Miss Juliet,&rdquo; he explained with twinkling eyes, &ldquo;my clients are
      all country folk, and it makes them feel more at home to find a lawyer&rsquo;s
      office not very different from their own parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would the great man say?&rdquo; she inquired, pointing to the rows of
      black tin boxes which lined the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave Seton is never likely to come here again, I am afraid,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;If he did, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d mind. To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m
      rather proud of my office, young lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are nice,&rdquo; she said decidedly, &ldquo;but unbusinesslike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to put up the pony and stay to lunch, of course?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ring for the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have come to see you&mdash;on business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth, after his first gasp of astonishment, was a different man.
      He fumbled about on the desk, and produced a pair of gold spectacles,
      which he adjusted with great nicety on the edge of his very short nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On business, my dear!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Well, well! To be sure! Is it Miss
      Harrison who has sent you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth&rsquo;s visitor looked positively annoyed. She leaned across the
      table towards him so that the roses in her large hat almost brushed his
      forehead. Her wonderful brown eyes were filled with reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pengarth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you know how old I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old, my dear? Why, let me see!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Fourteen and&mdash;why,
      God bless my soul, you must be eighteen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am nineteen years old, Mr. Pengarth,&rdquo; the young lady announced with
      dignity. &ldquo;Perhaps you will be kind enough to treat me now&mdash;er&mdash;with
      a little more respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen!&rdquo; he repeated vaguely. &ldquo;God bless my&mdash;nineteen years old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider myself,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;of age. I have come to see you about
      my affairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Quite natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For four years,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I seem to have been supported by some
      relative of my father, who has never vouchsafed to send me a single line
      or message except through you. I have written letters which I have given
      to you to forward. There has been no reply. Have you sent on those
      letters, Mr. Pengarth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why certainly, my dear, certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me how it is that I have had no answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth coughed. He was not at all comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your guardian, Miss Juliet, is somewhat eccentric,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and he
      is a very busy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me, Mr. Pengarth, exactly what relation he is to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence. Mr. Pengarth found the room suddenly warm, and
      mopped his forehead with a large silk handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no authority,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;to answer any questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then can you tell me of your own accord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why there is all
      this mystery? Why may I not know who he is, why may I not write to him? Am
      I anything to be ashamed of, that he will not trust me even with his name?
      I am tired of accepting so much and not being able to offer even my thanks
      in return. It is too much like charity! I have made up my mind that if
      this is to go on, I will go away and earn my own living! There, Mr.
      Pengarth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; he exclaimed briskly. &ldquo;What at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Painting!&rdquo; she declared triumphantly. &ldquo;I have had this in my mind for
      some time, and I have been trying to see what I can do best. I have quite
      decided, now, to be an artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pictures,&rdquo; he declared sententiously, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine do,&rdquo; she answered, smiling. &ldquo;I have had a check for three guineas
      from a shop in London for a little sea piece I did in two afternoons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wonderful child!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a child at all,&rdquo; she interrupted warmly, &ldquo;and you can just sit
      down and write to your silly client and tell him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will certainly write to him,&rdquo; he affirmed. &ldquo;I will do so today. You
      will not do anything rash until I have had time to get a reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she answered graciously. &ldquo;I will wait for a week. After that&mdash;well,
      I might do anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t leave Tredowen, Miss Juliet!&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would break my heart, of course,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;but I would do it and
      trust to time to heal it up again. Tredowen seems like home to me, but it
      isn&rsquo;t really, you know. Some day, Sir Wingrave Seton may want to come back
      and live there himself. Are you quite certain, Mr. Pengarth, that he won&rsquo;t
      be angry to hear that we have been living at the house all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; Mr. Pengarth declared firmly. &ldquo;He left everything entirely in
      my hands. He did not wish me to let it, but he did not care about its
      being altogether uninhabited. The arrangement I was able to make with your
      guardian was a most satisfactory one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely he will come back himself some time?&rdquo; she asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer shook his head sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Sir Wingrave has no affection for the place
      whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No affection for Tredowen,&rdquo; she repeated wonderingly. &ldquo;Do you know what I
      think, Mr. Pengarth? I think that it is the most beautiful house in the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you talk of leaving it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want to be accepting
      things all my life from someone whose name even I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must wait until I have written my letter. Time
      enough to talk about that later on. Now, if you won&rsquo;t stay to lunch, you
      must come and see Rachael and have some cake and a glass of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sweet of you,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightfully hungry. Can I do
      anything to stop growing, Mr. Pengarth? I&rsquo;m getting taller and taller!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood up. She was head and shoulders taller than the little lawyer,
      slim as a lath, and yet wonderfully graceful. She laughed down at him and
      made a little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a giraffe, am I not?&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m still growing. Do show
      me your garden, Mr. Pengarth. I want to see your hollyhocks. Everyone is
      talking about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were joined in a few minutes by a prim, dignified little lady,
      ridiculously like Mr. Pengarth, whom he called sister, and she Miss
      Rachael. Juliet walked down the garden between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; Mr. Pengarth said, &ldquo;Juliet has come today to see me on business.
      In effect, she has come to remind me that she is grown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grown up,&rdquo; Miss Rachael protested vigorously, &ldquo;rubbish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am nineteen years old,&rdquo; Juliet declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if you are,&rdquo; Miss Rachael replied briskly. &ldquo;In my young days we
      were in the nursery at nineteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; Mr. Pengarth assented with relief. &ldquo;You took me by storm just
      now, Miss Juliet. After all, you are only a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am old enough to feel and to mean all that I said to you, Mr.
      Pengarth,&rdquo; she answered gravely. &ldquo;And that reminds me, too&mdash;there was
      something else I meant to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; Mr. Pengarth said, &ldquo;have you ordered the wine and the cake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, no!&rdquo; Miss Rachael declared. &ldquo;It shall be ready in five
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She entered the house. Mr. Pengarth stooped to pick some lavender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only time I ever saw Sir Wingrave Seton,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was on the day
      before I was told that a relation of my father had been found, who was
      willing to take charge of me. There was a younger man with him, someone
      very, very different from Sir Wingrave. Do you know who he was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of secretary of Sir Wingrave, I believe, dear. I never met him. I
      was, unfortunately, away at the time they came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very nice and kind to me,&rdquo; the girl continued, &ldquo;just as nice as
      Sir Wingrave was horrid. I suppose it was because they came on that day,
      but I have always connected him somehow with this mysterious relation of
      mine. Mr. Aynesworth didn&rsquo;t help to find him, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; the lawyer answered. &ldquo;The instructions I had came first
      from Mr. Saunders, the vicar of the parish. It was he who appeared to have
      made the necessary inquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrid old man!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;He used to make me feel that I wanted to
      cry every time that I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Rachael is calling us,&rdquo; the lawyer declared with obvious relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New cake!&rdquo; Juliet declared, &ldquo;I can smell it! Delicious!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      LADY RUTH&rsquo;S LAST CARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two letters,&rdquo; Aynesworth announced, &ldquo;which I have not opened.
      One, I think, is from the Marchioness of Westhampton, the other from some
      solicitors at Truro. They were both marked private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave was at breakfast in his flat; Aynesworth had been in an adjoining
      room sorting his correspondence. He accepted the two letters, and glanced
      them through without remark. But whereas he bestowed scarcely a second&rsquo;s
      consideration upon the broad sheet of white paper with the small coronet
      and the faint perfume of violets, the second letter apparently caused him
      some annoyance. He read it through for a second time with a slight frown
      upon his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must cancel my engagements for two days, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      have to go out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing very special on,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Do you want me to go with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; he added, after a
      moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;to Cornwall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth was immediately silent. The one time when Wingrave had spoken
      to him as an employer, was in answer to some question of his as to what
      had eventually become of the treasures of Tredowen. He had always since
      scrupulously avoided the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be so good as to look out the trains for me,&rdquo; Wingrave continued. &ldquo;I
      cannot go until the afternoon,&rdquo; he added after a momentary pause. &ldquo;I have
      an engagement for luncheon. Perhaps, if you are not too busy, you will see
      that Morrison packs some things for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved to the writing table, and wrote a few lines to the Marchioness,
      regretting that his absence from town would prevent his dining with her on
      the following day. Then he studied the money column in several newspapers
      for half an hour, and telephoned to his broker. At eleven o&rsquo;clock, he rode
      for an hour in the quietest part of the park, avoiding, so far as
      possible, anyone he knew, and galloping whenever he could. It was the only
      form of exercise in which he was known to indulge although the knowledge
      of English games, which he sometimes displayed, was a little puzzling to
      some of his acquaintances. On his return, he made a simple but correct
      toilet, and at half-past one he met Lady Ruth at Prince&rsquo;s Restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth&rsquo;s gown of dove color, with faint touches of blue, was effective,
      and she knew it. Nevertheless, she was a little pale, and her manner
      lacked that note of quiet languor which generally characterized it. She
      talked rather more than usual, chattering idly about the acquaintances to
      whom she was continually nodding and bowing. Her face hardened a little as
      the Marchioness, on her way through the room with a party of friends,
      stopped at their table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women exchanged the necessary number of inanities, then the
      Marchioness turned to Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget that you are dining with me tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shook his head regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have to go out of town. I have just written
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bore,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Business, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded and passed on. Her farewell to Lady Ruth was distinctly curt.
      Wingrave resumed his seat and his luncheon without remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hateful woman,&rdquo; Lady Ruth murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were friends,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo; Lady Ruth assented, &ldquo;the sort of friendship you men don&rsquo;t
      know much about. You see a good deal of her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave raised his head and looked at Lady Ruth contemplatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask me that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curiosity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;you should be grateful to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may save you a similar infliction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth was silent for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I do not choose to be relieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave bowed, his glass in his hand. His lips were curled into the
      semblance of a smile, but he did not say a word. Lady Ruth leaned a little
      across the table so that the feathers of her hat nearly brushed his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;do you know what fear is? Perhaps not! You are a
      man, you see. No one has ever called me a coward. You wouldn&rsquo;t, would
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;you are not a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one sort of fear which I know,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and that is
      the fear of what I do not understand. And that is why, Wingrave, I am
      afraid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He set down his glass, and his fingers trifled for a moment with its stem.
      His expression was inscrutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are not serious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am serious,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;and you know that I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are afraid of me,&rdquo; he repeated softly. &ldquo;I wonder why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him straight in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I did you once a very grievous wrong. Because I know
      that you have not forgiven me. Because I am very sure that all the good
      that was in you lies slain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whose hand?&rdquo; he asked quietly. &ldquo;No! You need not answer. You know. So
      do I. Yes, I can understand your fear. But I do not understand why you
      confess it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Nor do I understand why I am here&mdash;at your
      bidding, nor why I keep you always by my side whenever you choose to take
      your place there. Are you a vain man, Wingrave? Do you wish to pose as the
      friend of a woman whom the world has thought too ambitious to waste time
      upon such follies? There is the Marchioness! She would do you more credit
      still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I like to choose the path myself when I pass
      into the maze of follies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not yet explained yourself,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;Of all people in
      world, you have chosen us for your presumptive friends. Why? You hate us
      both. You know that you do. Is it part of a scheme? Lumley is investing
      money on your advice, I am allowing myself to be seen about with you more
      than is prudent&mdash;considering all things. Do you want to rake out the
      ashes of our domestic hearth&mdash;to play the part of&mdash;melodramatic
      villain? You are ingenious enough, and powerful enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put strange ideas into my head,&rdquo; he told her lightly. &ldquo;Why should I
      not play the part that you suggest? It might be amusing, and you certainly
      deserve all the evil which I could bring upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned a little across the table towards him. Her eyes were soft and
      bright, and they looked full into his. The color in her cheeks was
      natural. The air around him was faintly fragrant with the perfume of her
      clothes and hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t leave off playing at the game&mdash;and act it, could we?&rdquo;
       she murmured. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t really&mdash;be friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth had played her trump card. She had touched his fingers with
      hers, her eyes shone with the promise of unutterable things. But if
      Wingrave was moved, he did not show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I could accept your offer in the spirit with
      which you tender it. Unfortunately, I am a maimed person. My sensibilities
      have gone. Friendship, in the more intimate sense of the word, I may never
      hope to feel again. Enmity&mdash;well, that is more comprehensible; even
      enmity,&rdquo; he continued slowly, &ldquo;which might prompt a woman to disguise
      herself as her own lady&rsquo;s maid, to seek out a tool to get rid of the man
      she feared. Pardon me, Lady Ruth, you are eating nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled down her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I have finished,&rdquo; she said in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called for the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t let my little remark distress you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had almost
      forgotten the circumstance until something you said brought it into my
      mind. It is you yourself, you must remember, who set the example of
      candor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deserve everything you can say,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;everything you can do.
      There is nothing left, I suppose, but suffering. Will you take me out to
      my carriage? You can come back and have your coffee with the Marchioness!
      She keeps looking across at you, and it will please her to think that you
      got rid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;that I must deny myself the pleasure of
      seeking the Marchioness again today. I have a train to catch in half an
      hour. You are ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made their way through the maze of tables towards the door, Lady Ruth
      exchanging greetings right and left with her friends, although the tall,
      grave-looking man who followed her was by far the greater object of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like Ruth to keep him in her pocket,&rdquo; remarked her dearest friend,
      looking after them; &ldquo;they say that he has millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed a little enviously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Barrington menage needs a little backing up,&rdquo; her companion remarked.
      &ldquo;I should say that he had come just in time. The Marchioness has her eye
      upon him too. There may be some fun presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth&rsquo;s dearest friend smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will back Ruth,&rdquo; she said drily. &ldquo;Emily is beautiful, but she is too
      obvious, and too eager! Ruth&rsquo;s little ways are more subtle. Besides, look
      at the start she has. She isn&rsquo;t the sort of woman men tire of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth held out her hand through the window of her electric coupe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for my luncheon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When shall we see you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few days,&rdquo; he answered, standing bareheaded upon the pavement. &ldquo;I
      shall call directly I return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth nodded and leaned back. Wingrave smiled faintly as he turned
      away. He had seen the little shudder which she had done her best to hide!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth found her husband at home, writing letters in his study. She
      sank wearily into a chair by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been lunching out?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Prince&rsquo;s, with Wingrave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no remark, but he seemed far from displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only had the pluck,&rdquo; he remarked a little disconsolately, &ldquo;I might
      have made thousands by following his advice this week. It was you who put
      me off, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It turned out all right?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly as he said. I made five hundred! I might just as well have made
      five thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you let me have a couple of hundred?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;The people are all
      bothering so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered irritably. &ldquo;I had to send the lot to
      Lewis, and then it wasn&rsquo;t a quarter of what he is pressing for. We shall
      never get through the season, Ruth, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless something turns up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short, uncomfortable silence. Lady Ruth rose to her feet and
      stood facing the fireplace with her back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lumley,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s face it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a little start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Face what?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruin, the Bankruptcy Court, and all the rest of it!&rdquo; she declared, a note
      of defiance creeping into her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband&rsquo;s face was white with astonishment. He stared across at her
      blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, Ruth?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you know what you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little sick of the whole show. The
      tradespeople are getting impertinent. I don&rsquo;t even know where to get
      flowers for dinner tonight or where to go for my Ascot gowns. It must come
      sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking like a fool,&rdquo; he declared harshly. &ldquo;Do you know that I
      should have to give up my seat and my clubs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could live quietly in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Country be&mdash;hanged!&rdquo; he exclaimed savagely. &ldquo;What use is the country
      to you and me? I&rsquo;d sooner put a bullet through my brain. Ruth, old lady,&rdquo;
       he added more gently, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s gone wrong? You&rsquo;re generally such a well
      plucked&rsquo;un! Have you&mdash;had a row with Wingrave?&rdquo; he asked, looking at
      her anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! I&rsquo;ve lost my nerve, I suppose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want a change! It isn&rsquo;t so very long to Cowes now and, thank heavens,
      that&rsquo;ll cost us nothing. We&rsquo;re going on Wingrave&rsquo;s yacht, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! We did accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington fidgeted for a moment with a paper knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong between you and Wingrave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of him, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of him! Afraid of Wingrave!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I do not think that he has forgotten. I think that he means to make
      us suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington was almost dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard such nonsense in my life, Ruth!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I have
      watched Wingrave closely, and I have seen no trace of anything of the
      sort. Nonsense! It is worse than nonsense! You must be getting hysterical.
      You must get all this rubbish out of your head. To tell you the truth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking that you might ask Wingrave to help us a bit. I don&rsquo;t
      believe he&rsquo;d hesitate for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth looked her husband in the face. There was a curious expression in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that it would be wise of me to ask him?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You can take care of yourself. I can trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that I was afraid of Wingrave,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;I can take
      care of myself as a rule&mdash;and I do&mdash;as you know. I have elected
      to be one of the unfashionables in that respect. But to ask Wingrave for
      money is more than I dare do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall ask him myself,&rdquo; Barrington declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up her gloves and turned to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer even that,&rdquo; she said.

    <h2>
      GUARDIAN AND WARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to the present, then,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;the child has no idea as to
      who has been responsible for the charge of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea at all, Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; the lawyer declared. &ldquo;Your wishes have
      been strictly carried out, most strictly. She imagines that it is some
      unknown connection of her father. But, as I explained to you in my letter,
      she has recently exhibited a good deal of curiosity in the matter. She is&mdash;er&mdash;a
      young lady of considerable force of character for her years, and her
      present attitude&mdash;as I explained in my letter&mdash;is a trifle
      difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave was sitting in the lawyer&rsquo;s own chair. Mr. Pengarth, who was a
      trifle nervous, preferred to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shows, I think, a certain amount of ingratitude in forcing this
      journey and explanation upon me,&rdquo; Wingrave declared coldly. &ldquo;It should
      have been sufficient for her that her benefactor preferred to remain
      anonymous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret, Sir Wingrave, that I must disagree with you,&rdquo; Mr. Pengarth
      answered boldly. &ldquo;Miss Juliet, Miss Lundy I should say, is a young lady of
      character&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;some originality of disposition. She is
      a great favorite with everyone around here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave remained silent. He had the air of one not troubling to reply to
      what he considered folly. Through the wide open window floated in the
      various sounds of the little country town, the rumbling of heavy carts
      passing along the cobbled streets, the shrill greetings of neighbors and
      acquaintances meeting upon the sidewalk. And then the tinkling bell of a
      rubber-tired cart pulling up outside, and a clear girlish voice speaking
      to some one of the passers-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave betrayed as much surprise as it was possible for him to show when
      at last she stood with outstretched hand before him. He had only an
      imperfect recollection of an ill-clad, untidy-looking child, with pale
      tear-stained cheeks, and dark unhappy eyes. The march of the years had
      been a thing whose effects he had altogether underestimated. The girl who
      stood now facing him was slight, and there was something of the child left
      in her bright eager face, but she carried herself with all the graceful
      assurance of an older woman. Her soft, dark eyes were lit with pleasure
      and excitement, her delicately traced eyebrows and delightful smile were
      somehow suggestive of her foreign descent. Her clothes were country-made,
      but perfect as regarded fit and trimness, her beflowered hat was worn with
      a touch of coquettish grace, a trifle un-English, but very delightful. She
      had not an atom of shyness or embarrassment. Only there was a great
      surprise in her face as she held out her hands to Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who you are,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You are Sir Wingrave Seton. To think
      that I never guessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember seeing me, then?&rdquo; he remarked, and his tone sounded all the
      colder after the full richness of her young voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just remember it&mdash;only just,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You see you did not
      take much notice of me that time, did you? But I have lived amongst your
      ancestors too long to make any mistake. Why have you stayed away from
      Tredowen so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been abroad,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I am not fond of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had trouble here, I know,&rdquo; she said frankly. &ldquo;But that is all past
      and over. I think that you must forget how beautiful your home is or you
      would never bear to live away from it. Now, please, may I ask you a
      question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any that you think necessary,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;Spare me as much as
      possible; I am not fond of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I leave you two together for a little time?&rdquo; Mr. Pengarth
      suggested, gathering up some papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Wingrave said shortly. &ldquo;There is not the slightest
      necessity for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But you must sit down, Juliet. There,
      you shall have my clients&rsquo; chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl accepted it with a little laugh. There was no shadow of
      embarrassment about her manner, notwithstanding the cold stiffness of
      Wingrave&rsquo;s deportment. He sat where the sunlight fell across his chair,
      and the lines in his pale face seemed deeper than usual, the grey hairs
      more plentiful, the weariness in his eyes more apparent. Yet she was not
      in the least afraid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, then, Sir Wingrave, may I ask you why you have been so
      extraordinarily kind to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing extraordinary about it at all,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Your
      father died and left you friendless in a parish of which I am Lord of the
      Manor. He received a starvation pittance for his labors, which it was my
      duty to augment, a duty which, with many others, I neglected. I simply
      gave orders that you should be looked after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looked after! Why, I have lived at Tredowen. I have had a governess, a
      pony to drive. Heaven knows how many luxuries!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he interrupted hastily, &ldquo;is nothing. The house is better occupied.
      What I have done for you is less in proportion than the sixpence you may
      sometimes have given to a beggar for I am a rich, a ridiculously rich man,
      with no possible chance of spending one-quarter of my income. You had a
      distinct and obvious claim upon me, and, at no cost or inconvenience to
      myself, I have endeavored, through others, to recognize it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accept your view of the situation,&rdquo; the girl said, still smiling,
      but with a faint note of disappointment in her tone. &ldquo;I do not wish to
      force upon you expressions of gratitude which you would only find
      wearisome. But I must thank you! It is in my heart, and I must speak of
      it. There, it is over, you see! I shall say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a sensible young lady,&rdquo; Wingrave said, making a motion as though
      to rise. &ldquo;I have only one request to make to you, and that is that you
      keep to yourself the knowledge which Mr. Pengarth informs me that you
      insisted upon acquiring. You are nearly enough of age now, and I will make
      you your own mistress. That is all, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile died away from her lips. Her tone became very earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for all that you have done for me, I am, as you
      know grateful. I would try to tell you how grateful, only I know that it
      would weary you. So we will speak only of the future. I cannot continue to
      accept&mdash;even such magnificent alms as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, child?&rdquo; he asked, frowning across at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that now I am old enough to work, I cannot accept
      everything from one upon whom I have no claim. If you will help me a
      little still, I shall be more than grateful. But it must be in my own
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk about work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can paint,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;fairly well. I should like to go to London
      and have a few lessons. If I cannot make a living at that, I shall try
      something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You disappoint me,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;There is no place for you in London.
      There are thousands starving there already because they can paint a
      little, or sing a little, or fancy they can. Do you find it dull down
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dull!&rdquo; she exclaimed wonderingly. &ldquo;I think that there can be no place on
      earth so beautiful as Tredowen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are happy here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, forget all this folly,&rdquo; Wingrave said hardly.
      &ldquo;London is no place for children. Miss Harrison can take you up for a
      month when you choose. You can go abroad if you want to. But for the rest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose suddenly, and sweeping across the office with one graceful
      movement, she leaned over Wingrave&rsquo;s chair. Her hands rested upon his
      shoulders, her eyes, soft with gathering tears, pleaded with his. Wingrave
      sat with all the outward immobility of a Sphinx.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have been so generous, so kind, and I
      may not even speak of my gratitude. Don&rsquo;t please think me unreasonable or
      ungracious. I can&rsquo;t tell you how I feel, but I must, I must, I must go
      away. I could not live here any longer now that I know. Fancy for a moment
      that I am your sister, or your daughter! Don&rsquo;t you believe, really, that
      she would feel the same? And I think you would wish her to. Don&rsquo;t be angry
      with me, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave&rsquo;s face never changed; but his fingers gripped the arms of his
      chair so that a signet ring he wore cut deep into his flesh. When he
      spoke, his tone sounded almost harsh. The girl turned away to dash the
      tears from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of this&mdash;folly, Pengarth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer looked his best client squarely in the face. &ldquo;I do not call it
      folly, Sir Wingrave. I think that Miss Lundy is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Her eyes were still pleading with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against the two of you,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;I am, of course, powerless.
      After all, it is no concern of mine. I shall leave you, Pengarth, to make
      such arrangements as Miss Lundy desires!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet. Juliet now was pale. She dashed the tears from her
      eyes and looked at him in amazement mingled with something which was
      almost like despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you are going away without coming to
      Tredowen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I never had any intention of going there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very angry with me,&rdquo; she cried in despair. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lip quivered. Wingrave interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be happy to go and have a look at the place,&rdquo; he said carelessly,
      &ldquo;if you will drive me back. I fancy I have almost forgotten what it is
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him as at one who had spoken irreverently. Her eyes were
      full of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you must have indeed forgotten,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how very
      beautiful it is. It is your home too! There is no one else,&rdquo; she added
      softly, &ldquo;who can live there, amongst all those wonderful things, and call
      it really&mdash;home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will find that I have outlived all sentiment;
      but I will certainly come to Tredowen with you!&rdquo;
     </p>

      GHOSTS OF DEAD THINGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was here,&rdquo; she said, as they passed through the walled garden
      seawards, &ldquo;that I saw you first&mdash;you and the other gentleman who was
      so kind to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that I remember it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you were a mournful-looking
      object in a very soiled pinafore and most untidy hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had been out on the cliffs,&rdquo; she reminded him, &ldquo;where I am taking you
      now. If you are going to make unkind remarks about my hair, I think that I
      had better fetch a hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t leave me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I should certainly lose my way. Your
      hair in those days was, I fancy, a little more&mdash;unkempt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It used to be cut short,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hideous! There! Isn&rsquo;t that
      glorious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had opened the postern gate in the wall, and through the narrow
      opening was framed a wonderful picture of the Cornish sea, rolling into
      the rock-studded bay. Its soft thunder was in their ears; salt and
      fragrant, the west wind swept into their faces. She closed the gate behind
      her, and stepped blithely forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We will climb the cliffs where we left you alone once
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Side by side they stood looking over the ocean. Her head was thrown back,
      her lips a little parted. He watched her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have sea blood in your veins,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You listen as
      though you heard music all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo; she asked him, smiling. &ldquo;You are the grandson of
      Admiral Sir Wingrave Seton who commanded a frigate at Trafalgar, and an
      ancestor of yours fought in the Armada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;that there is a hiatus in my life
      somewhere. There are no voices which call to me any more, and my family
      records are so much dead parchment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trouble passed into her glowing face and clouded her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not like to hear you talk so. Do you know that when
      you do, you make me afraid that something I have always hoped for will
      never come to pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always hoped,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that some day you would come once more
      to Tredowen. I suppose I am rather a fanciful person. This is a country of
      superstitions and fancies, you know; but sometimes when I have been alone
      in the picture gallery with all that long line of dark faces looking down
      upon me from the walls, I have felt like an interloper. Always they seem
      to be waiting! Tonight, after dinner, I will take you there. I will try
      and show you what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never come back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and there are no more of my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. When at last she spoke, the color was coming and going in
      her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am only an ignorant girl, and I have no right
      to talk to you like this. Please be angry with me if you want to. I
      deserve it. I know all about&mdash;that ten years! Couldn&rsquo;t you forget it,
      and come back? None of the country people round here, your own people,
      believe anything evil about you. You were struck, and you struck back
      again. A man would do that. You could be as lonely as you liked here, or
      you could have friends if you wished for them. But this is the place where
      you ought to live. You would be happier here, I believe, than in exile.
      The love of it all would come back, you would never be lonely. It is the
      same sea which sang to you when you were a child, and to your fathers
      before you. It would bring you forgetfulness when you wanted it, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave interrupted her. His tone was cold, but not unkind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is very good of you to be so
      sympathetic, but I am afraid I am not at all the sort of person you
      imagine me to be. What I was before those ten years&mdash;well, I have
      forgotten. What I am now, I unfortunately know. I am a soured, malevolent
      being whose only pleasure lies in the dealing out to others some portion
      of the unhappiness which was dealt out to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; she declared briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, it is true,&rdquo; he declared coolly. &ldquo;Listen! More or less you
      interest me. I will tell you something which I have never yet told to a
      single human being. I need not go into particulars. You will probably
      believe a broad statement. My ten years&rsquo; imprisonment was more or less an
      injustice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He checked her. There was not a tremor in his tone. The gesture with which
      he had repelled her was stiff and emotionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went into prison one man, I came out another. While I live, I shall
      never be able to think kindly again of a single one of my fellow
      creatures. It was not my fault. So far as our affections are concerned, we
      are machines, all of us. Well, my mainspring has broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, nevertheless, true,&rdquo; he affirmed calmly. &ldquo;I am living in exile
      because I have no friends, because friends have become an impossibility to
      me. I shall not tell you any more of my life because you are young and you
      would not believe me if I did. Some day,&rdquo; he added grimly, &ldquo;you will
      probably hear for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never believe anything,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;which I do not choose to
      believe. I shall never believe, for instance, that you are quite what you
      think yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will talk of other things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Five years ago, you showed
      Aynesworth where the seagulls built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I will show you,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if you are sure that your head
      is steady enough. Come along!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after dinner that she took him into the picture gallery. Miss
      Harrison, very much disturbed by the presence of the master of Tredowen,
      and still more so by the hint which she had already received as to coming
      changes, followed them at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; Juliet said, &ldquo;that we have no cigars or cigarettes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seldom smoke,&rdquo; Wingrave answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only we had had the slightest idea of your coming,&rdquo; Miss Harrison said
      for the tenth time, &ldquo;we would have made more adequate preparations. The
      wine cellar, at least, could have been opened. I allowed Mr. and Mrs.
      Tresfarwin to go for their holiday only yesterday, and the cellars, of
      course, are never touched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your claret was excellent,&rdquo; Wingrave assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure,&rdquo; Miss Harrison said, &ldquo;that claret from the local grocer
      is not what you are accustomed to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; Wingrave protested, &ldquo;I seldom touch wine. Show me which
      picture it is, Juliet, that you&mdash;ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had led him to the end of the gallery and stopped before what seemed
      to be a plain oak cupboard surrounded by a massive frame. She looked at
      him half fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to see that picture?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a bunch of keys from his pocket and calmly selected one. It was a
      little rusty, but the cupboard turned at once on its hinges. A woman&rsquo;s
      face smiled down upon them, dark and splendid, from the glowing touch of a
      great painter. Juliet studied it eagerly, and then stole a sidelong glance
      at the man by her side. He was surveying it critically and without any
      apparent emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herkomer&rsquo;s, I think,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Quite one of his best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your mother?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not great at genealogy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I can go as far back as that.
      She was by way of being a great lady, the daughter of the Duke of
      Warminster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were an only son,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;She must have been very fond of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Customary thing, I suppose,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Lucky for her, under the
      circumstances, that she died young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the oaken door in front of the picture, and locked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see the armory,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I really forget&mdash;let
      me see, it is at the end of the long gallery, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him there without a word. She was getting a little afraid of him.
      They inspected the library and wandered back into the picture gallery. It
      was she, now, who was silent. She had shown him all her favorite treasures
      without being able to evoke a single spark of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;we all had a terrible fright. We were told that
      everything was going to be sold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did think of it,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;but there seemed to be no hurry. All
      these things are growing into money year by year. Some day I shall send
      everything to Christie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot&mdash;oh, you cannot mean it?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? They are no use to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall see them again for many years. And the
      money&mdash;well, one can use that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought&mdash;that you were rich?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and yet I go on making more and more, and I shall
      go on. Money is the whip with which its possessor can scourge humanity. It
      is with money that I deal out my&mdash;forgive me, I forgot that I was
      talking aloud, and to a child,&rdquo; he wound up suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, dry-eyed, but with a strained look of sorrow strangely
      altering her girlish face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be very unhappy,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I am one of those fortunate persons who
      have outlived happiness and unhappiness. I have nothing to do but live&mdash;and
      pay off a few little debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose directly afterwards, and she walked with him out to the gardens
      whence a short cut led to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not tried again to make you change your mind,&rdquo; he said as they
      stood for a moment on the terrace. &ldquo;If my wishes have any weight with you,
      I trust that you will do nothing without consulting Mr. Pengarth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;are you&mdash;never in London? Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I
      see you again any time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you care to, by all means,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Tell Mr. Pengarth to let me
      have your address. Goodbye! Thank you for taking care of my treasures so
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held his cold hand in hers and suddenly raised it to her lips. Then
      she turned away and hurried indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave stood still for a moment and gazed at his hand through the
      darkness as though the ghosts of dead things had flitted out from the dark
      laurel shrubs. Then he laughed quietly to himself.

    <h2>
      SPREADING THE NETS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; the Marchioness asked him, &ldquo;have you a Christian name?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Wingrave answered, &ldquo;if I ever had, I&rsquo;ve forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must call you Wingrave,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I hate calling anyone I
      know decently well Mr. anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmed,&rdquo; Wingrave answered; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a bad name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; she continued, looking at him
      critically, &ldquo;you are rather a surprising person, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;ve found it out,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I always thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One associates all sorts of terrible things with millionaires&mdash;especially
      African and American ones,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Now you could pass anywhere for
      the ordinary sort of decent person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told the other day,&rdquo; he remarked reflectively, &ldquo;that if I would
      only cultivate two things, I might almost pass as a member of the English
      aristocracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were they?&rdquo; she asked rashly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignorance and impertinence,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness was silent for a moment. There was a little more color
      than usual in her beautiful cheeks and a dangerous glitter in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go home, Mr. Wingrave,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet imperturbably. The Marchioness stretched out a long
      white hand and gently forced him back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk like that to me,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I am sensitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A privilege, I believe, of your order,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you want to quarrel&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be sensible! I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sensible, alone with you!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I should establish a new
      record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly aren&rsquo;t in the least like a millionaire,&rdquo; she declared,
      smiling at him, &ldquo;you are more like a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go on,&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she answered, shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you aren&rsquo;t in the least like a marchioness,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;At least,
      not like our American ideas of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring your chair quite close to mine,&rdquo; she ordered, &ldquo;I really want to
      talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, and affected to be absorbed in the contemplation of the rings
      on the hand which a great artist had called the most beautiful in England.
      She withdrew it a little peevishly, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk about the Barringtons,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know that they
      are practically ruined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that Barrington had been gambling on the Stock Exchange the last
      few days,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has lost a great deal of money,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and they were almost
      on their last legs before. Are you going to set them straight again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been asked, for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth will ask you, of course,&rdquo; the Marchioness said impatiently. &ldquo;I
      expect that she is waiting at your flat by now. I want to know whether you
      are going to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand was again very close to his. Again Wingrave contemplated the
      rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot that you were her friend, and are naturally anxious,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not her friend,&rdquo; the Marchioness answered, &ldquo;and&mdash;I do not wish
      you to help them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave was silent. The hand was insistent, and he held it for a moment
      lightly, and then let it go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said doubtfully. &ldquo;The Barringtons have been very
      hospitable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; the Marchioness answered. &ldquo;You have done quite enough for them
      already. Of course, you are a man&mdash;and you must choose. I am sure
      that you understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must think this out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Barringtons have a sort of claim on
      me. I will let you know which way I decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood close to him, and her hand fell upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have told them that I am at home to
      no one, and I thought that you would stay and entertain me. Sit down
      again, Wingrave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have a lot to do this afternoon. I came directly
      I had your note; but I have had to keep some other people waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to see Lady Ruth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I have heard nothing from her. By the
      bye, I lost some money to you at bridge the other evening. How much was
      it? Do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for a second, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want to know?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please. Put the amount down on a piece of paper, and then I
      sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room to her desk, and returned with a folded envelope. He
      stuffed it into his waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be at the opera tonight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you come there and tell
      me what&mdash;which you decide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;if I can get away from a stupid dinner in
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let him go reluctantly. Afterwards she passed into her own room, and
      stood looking at herself in the pier glass. Artists and the society papers
      called her the most beautiful woman in England; fashion had placed her
      upon such a pinnacle that men counted it a distinction to be seen speaking
      to her. She dealt out her smiles and favors like Royalty itself; she had
      never once known a rebuff. This afternoon she felt that she had received
      one. Had she been too cold or too forward? Perhaps she had underestimated
      the man himself. She rang for her maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall wear my new Paquin gown tonight at the
      opera, and my pearls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, your ladyship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am going to lie down for an hour or two now. Don&rsquo;t let me be
      disturbed. I want to look my best tonight. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, your ladyship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness rested, but she did not sleep. She was thinking of
      Wingrave!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not Lady Ruth, but her husband, who was waiting to see Wingrave on
      his return. Aynesworth was talking to him, but at once withdrew. Wingrave
      nodded with slightly upraised eyebrows. He never shook hands with
      Barrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see me?&rdquo; he inquired, carelessly turning over a little pile
      of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrington was ill at ease. He hated himself and he hated his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for a moment or two&mdash;if you&rsquo;re not busy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I
      smoke? I&rsquo;m nervous this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo; Wingrave said shortly. &ldquo;Cigarettes and cigars on the
      sideboard. Touch the bell if you&rsquo;ll take anything to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks&mdash;Aynesworth gave me a brandy and soda. Capital fellow,
      Aynesworth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have another,&rdquo; Wingrave said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the room to the sideboard. Wingrave glanced up from his
      letters, and smiled coldly as he saw the shaking fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often indulge like this,&rdquo; Barrington said, turning away from the
      sideboard with a tumbler already empty in his hands. &ldquo;The fact is, I&rsquo;ve
      had rather a rude knock, and Ruth thought I&rsquo;d better come and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave remained a study of impassivity. His guest&rsquo;s whole demeanor, his
      uneasy words and nervous glances were an unspoken appeal to be helped out
      in what he had come to say. And Wingrave knew very well what it was.
      Nevertheless, he remained silent&mdash;politely questioning. Barrington
      sat down a little heavily. He was not so carefully dressed as usual; he
      looked older, his appearance lacked altogether that air of buoyant
      prosperity which was wont to inspire his friends and creditors with
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a fool, Wingrave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You showed me how to make a little
      money a few weeks ago, and it seemed so easy that I couldn&rsquo;t resist having
      a try by myself, only on rather a larger scale. I lost! Then I went in
      again to pull myself round, and I lost again. I lost&mdash;more than I can
      easily raise before settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Wingrave said politely. &ldquo;It is very unwise to meddle in
      things you know so little about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the worm turned. Barrington rose to his feet, and with a deep
      flush upon his cheeks moved towards the door. But his spark of genuine
      feeling died out almost as soon as it had been kindled. Outside that door
      was ruin; within, as he very well knew, lay his only chance of salvation.
      He set down his hat, and turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you lend me some money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked at him with upraised eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;lend you money? Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; Barrington answered. &ldquo;It is you who have chosen to seek us
      out. You have forced upon us something which has at least the semblance of
      friendship. There is no one else whom I could ask. It isn&rsquo;t only this
      damned Stock Exchange transaction. Everything has gone wrong with me for
      years. If I could have kept going till next July, I should have been all
      right. I have made a little success in the House, and I am promised a
      place in the next government. I know it seems queer that I should be
      asking you, but it is that&mdash;or ruin. Now you know how things are with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making,&rdquo; Wingrave said quietly, &ldquo;a mistake. I have not pretended
      or given the slightest evidence of any friendship for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington looked at him with slowly mounting color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Wingrave interrupted. &ldquo;I do not know what I might or might
      not do for Lady Ruth. I have not considered the subject. It has not, in
      fact, been presented to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same thing,&rdquo; Barrington declared hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me&mdash;it is not,&rdquo; Wingrave answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I ask you to do,&rdquo; Barrington said, &ldquo;I ask on behalf of my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As an ambassador,&rdquo; Wingrave said coldly, &ldquo;you are not acceptable to me.
      It is a matter which I could only discuss with Lady Ruth herself. If Lady
      Ruth has anything to say to me, I will hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington stood quite still for several moments. The veins on his
      forehead stood out like tightly drawn cords, his breath came with
      difficulty. The light in his eyes, as he looked at Wingrave, was almost
      murderous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Lady Ruth desires to see me,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked slowly, &ldquo;I shall be
      here at nine o&rsquo;clock this evening. Tomorrow my movements are uncertain.
      You will excuse me if I hurry you away now. I have an engagement which is
      already overdue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington took up his hat and left the room without a word. Wingrave
      remained in his chair. His eyes followed the departing figure of his
      visitor. When he was absolutely sure that he was alone, he covered his
      face with one hand. His engagement seemed to have been with his thoughts
      for he did not stir for nearly an hour later. Then he rang the bell for
      Aynesworth.
    </p>

    <h2>
      IN THE TOILS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wingrave did not speak for several moments after Aynesworth had entered
      the room. He had an engagement book before him and seemed to be deep in
      its contents. When at last he looked up, his forehead was furrowed with
      thought, and he had the weary air of a man who has been indulging in
      unprofitable memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be so good as to ring up Walters and excuse me
      from dining with him tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any particular form of excuse?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Say that I have an unavoidable engagement. I will see him tomorrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked, preparing to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! You might see that I have no visitors this evening. Lady Ruth is
      coming here at nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth is coming here,&rdquo; Aynesworth repeated in a colorless tone.
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders, but made no remark. He turned towards
      the door, but Wingrave called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your expression, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;interests me. Am I or the lady in
      question responsible for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for Lady Ruth,&rdquo; Aynesworth said. &ldquo;I think that I am sorry,
      too, for her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? She is coming of her own free will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are different methods of compulsion,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave regarded him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is true. But I still do not understand why you are sorry
      for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, &ldquo;I know the history of a certain event, and I
      know you. It is, I suppose, for this end that you made use of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I think that the time is not far off when
      that dear lady and I can cry quits. This time, too, I see nothing to
      impair my satisfaction at the probable finale. In various other cases, as
      you might remember, I have not been entirely successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked drily, &ldquo;upon what you term success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;that you are aware of what my feelings and
      desired course of action have been with regard to those of my fellow
      creatures with whom I have happened to come into contact. It seems to me
      that I have been a trifle unfortunate in several instances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for instance?&rdquo; Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to take a few cases only,&rdquo; Wingrave continued, &ldquo;there was the child
      down at Tredowen whom you were so anxious for me to befriend. Of course, I
      declined to do anything of the sort, and she ought, by rights, to have
      gone to some charitable institution, founded and supported by fools, and
      eventually become, perhaps, a domestic servant. Instead of which, some
      relation of her father turns up and provides for her lavishly. You must
      admit that that was unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon the point of view,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked drily.
      &ldquo;Personally, I considered it a most fortunate occurrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Wingrave agreed. &ldquo;But then you are a sentimentalist. You like
      to see people happy, and you would even help to make them so if you could
      without any personal inconvenience. I am at the other pole. If I could
      collect humanity into one sentient force, I would set my heel upon it
      without hesitation. I try to do what I can with the atoms, but I have not
      the best of fortune. There was Mrs. Travers, now! There I should have been
      successful beyond a doubt if some busybody hadn&rsquo;t sent that cable to her
      husband. I wonder if you were idiot enough to do that, Aynesworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had thought of the Marconigram,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, &ldquo;I am sure I
      should have done it. But as a matter of fact, I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as well, so far as our relations are concerned,&rdquo; Wingrave said
      coldly. &ldquo;I did manage to make poor men of a few brokers in New York, but
      my best coup went wrong. That boy would have blown his brains out, I
      believe, if some meddling idiot hadn&rsquo;t found him all that money at the
      last moment. I have had a few smaller successes, of course, and there is
      this affair of Lady Ruth and her estimable husband. You know that he came
      to borrow money of me, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed it,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;You should be modern in your revenge
      and lend it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave smiled coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Lumley Barrington will find my revenge modern
      enough. I may lend the money they need&mdash;but it will be to Lady Ruth!
      I told her husband so a few minutes ago. I told him to send his wife to
      me. He has gone to tell her now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked, &ldquo;that he did not thrash you&mdash;or try
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Wingrave&rsquo;s lips parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moral deterioration has set in already,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;When he pays his
      bills with my money, he will lose the little he has left of his
      self-respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth turned abruptly away. He was strongly tempted to say things
      which would have ended his connection with Wingrave, and as yet he was not
      ready to leave. For the sake of a digression, he took up a check book from
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three checks,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;which I cannot trace. One for ten
      thousand pounds, another for five, and a third for a thousand pounds. What
      account shall I put them to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private drawing account,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;They represent a small
      speculation. By the bye, you&rsquo;d better go and ring up Walters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish the particulars entered in your sundry investment book?&rdquo;
       Aynesworth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You can put them to drawing account. If you
      want me again this evening, I shall dine at the Cafe Royal at eight
      o&rsquo;clock, and shall return here at five minutes to nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     . . . . . . . . . . .
</pre>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth was punctual. At a few minutes past nine, Morrison announced
      that a lady had called to see Mr. Wingrave by appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can show her in,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;See that we are not disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth was scarcely herself. She was dressed in a high-necked muslin
      gown, and she wore a hat and veil, which somewhat obscured her features.
      The latter she raised, however, as she accepted the chair which Wingrave
      had placed for her. He saw then that she was pale, and her manner betrayed
      an altogether unfamiliar nervousness. She avoided his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you expect me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I thought that you would come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her foot, long and slender, beat impatiently upon the ground. She looked
      up at him once, but immediately withdrew her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you bring me here?&rdquo; she asked in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady Ruth!&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to play at being friends,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for heaven&rsquo;s sake call
      me Ruth. You found it easy enough once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Ruth, by all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now will you answer my question?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;to help
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Us&mdash;no!&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;you&mdash;perhaps yes!&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she looked at him, and found herself puzzled by the perfect
      impassivity of his features. Surely he would drop the mask now. He had
      insisted upon her coming!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What then&mdash;are the conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent over towards her. Curiously enough, there was, mingled with many
      other sensations, a certain sense of triumph in the thought, it was almost
      a hope, that at last he was going to betray himself, that he was going to
      admit tacitly, or by imputation, that her power over him was not wholly
      dead. It was a terrible situation&mdash;in her heart she felt so, but it
      had its compensations. Wingrave had been her constant attendant for
      months. He had seen her surrounded by men, all anxious to secure a smile
      from her; he had seen her play the great lady in her own house, and she
      played it very well. She knew that she was a past mistress in the arts
      which fascinate his sex, she understood the quiet speeches, the moods,
      every trick of the gamester in emotions, from the fluttering of eyelids to
      the unchaining of the passions. And he had loved her. Underneath it all,
      he must love her now. She was determined that he should tell her so. It
      was genuine excitement which throbbed in her pulses, a genuine color which
      burned in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conditions?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You believe, then, that I mean to make
      conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his, eloquent eyes she knew, and looked at him. The
      mask was still there&mdash;but he had moved a little nearer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You must tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. She had scarcely given herself credit for
      such capacity for emotion. He was on his feet. Surely the mask must go
      now! And then&mdash;she felt that it must be a nightmare. It was
      incredible! He had struck a match and was calmly lighting a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One,&rdquo; he said coolly, &ldquo;is that Mademoiselle Violet employs no more
      amateur assassins to make clumsy attempts upon my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat in her place rigid&mdash;half frozen with a cold, numbing fear. He
      had sent for her, then, only to mock her. She had failed! They were not
      even to have the money! Speech was quite impossible. Then he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take your assent for granted,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you know how much you
      require to free yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About eight thousand pounds!&rdquo; she answered mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and wrote a check, which he laid before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to endorse that,&rdquo; he remarked in a matter-of-fact tone.
      &ldquo;Your name at the back will do instead of a receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your money,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I will not touch it. Please open the door
      for me! I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means&mdash;if you wish it,&rdquo; he answered undisturbed. &ldquo;At the same
      time, I am curious to know why you came here at all if you did not intend
      to accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She faced him, hot and angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did intend to accept it,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It is that or ruin. But you
      are too cruel! You make it&mdash;impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I suppose you know best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake tell me,&rdquo; she cried passionately, &ldquo;what has come to
      you, what manner of a man are you? You loved me once! Now, even, after all
      these years, you cannot deny it. You have gone out of your way to be with
      me, to be my companion wherever we are. People are beginning to smile when
      they see us together. I don&rsquo;t mind. I&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake tell me,
      Wingrave! Why do you do it? Why do you lend me this money? What can I do
      for you? What do you want me to be? Are you as cold as a stone? Have you
      no heart&mdash;no heart even for friendship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not seek,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to buy&mdash;your friendship with a
      check!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is yours already,&rdquo; she cried, holding out her hands. &ldquo;Give me a
      little kindness, Wingrave! You make me feel and seem a perfect idiot. Why,
      I&rsquo;d rather you asked me anything that treated me like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was under the impression,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;that I was behaving
      rather well. I wonder what would really satisfy you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have you behave as you are doing, and want to behave differently,&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;You are magnificent&mdash;but it is because you are indifferent.
      Will you kiss me, Wingrave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure!&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew away from him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;another woman?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;The Marchioness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eagerness was almost painful. He did not answer her at once. She
      caught hold of his wrist and drew him towards her. Her eyes searched his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marchioness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a very beautiful woman. She does not,
      however, affect the situation as between you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she dared!&rdquo; Lady Ruth murmured. &ldquo;Wingrave, won&rsquo;t you try and be
      friends with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You would be surprised,
      however, if you could realize the effect of a long period of enforced
      seclusion upon a man of my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she shrieked; &ldquo;stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My temperament, I was about to say,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;There was a time when
      I am afraid I might have been tempted, under such circumstances as these,
      to forget that you were no longer free, to forget everything that except
      we were alone, and that you&mdash;are as beautiful as ever you were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she murmured, moving imperceptibly a little nearer towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the check and gave it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no actor,&rdquo; he said, looking at her steadily. &ldquo;At present, I make no
      conditions. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned towards him. He took her face between his hands and kissed her
      on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may make them later,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I reserve my right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for a moment, and dropped her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take me down to my carriage,&rdquo; she asked.

    <h2>
      THE INDISCRETION OF THE MARCHIONESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly certain,&rdquo; Juliet declared, &ldquo;that we ought not to be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked, fanning himself lightly with his pocket
      handkerchief, &ldquo;may account for the extraordinary sense of pleasure which I
      am now experiencing. At the same time, I can&rsquo;t see why not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only met you this afternoon&mdash;a few hours ago. And here we are,
      absolutely wedged together on these seats&mdash;and my chaperon is dozing
      half the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; Aynesworth objected, &ldquo;I knew you when you were a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; Aynesworth persisted, &ldquo;the fact remains. If you date our
      acquaintance from this afternoon, I do not. I have never forgotten the
      little girl in short frocks and long black hair, who showed me where the
      seagulls built, and told me Cornish fairy stories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very long time ago,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four years,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;for you, perhaps, a long time, because you
      have changed from a child&mdash;into a woman. But for a man approaching
      middle age&mdash;as I am&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but I am not sure that we ought to
      be in the gallery at Covent Garden together, with a chaperon who will
      sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will wake up,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;with the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;will dream. Isn&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how it really seems to you,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;We are breathing an
      atmosphere hot with gas, and fragrant with orange peel. We are squashed in
      amongst a crowd of people of a class whom I fancy that neither you nor I
      know much about. And I saw you last in a wilderness! We saw only the
      yellow sands, and the rocks, and the Atlantic. We heard only the thunder
      of the sea and the screaming of seagulls. This is very different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderfully, wonderfully different,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I miss it all! Of
      course I do, and yet one is so much nearer to life here, the real life of
      men and women. Oh, one cannot compare it. Why should one try? Ah, listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curtain went up. The music of the orchestra subsided, and the music of
      the human voice floated through the Opera House&mdash;the human voice,
      vibrant with joy and passion and the knowledge which lies behind the veil.
      Juliet found no time to talk then, no time to think even of her companion.
      Her young cheeks were flushed, her eyes were bright with excitement. She
      leaned a little forward in her place, she passed with all the effortless
      facility of her ingenuous youth, into the dim world of golden fancies
      which the story of the opera was slowly unfolding. Beside her, Mrs.
      Tresfarwin dozed and blinked and dozed again&mdash;and on her left
      Aynesworth himself, a little affected by the music, still found time to
      glance continually at his companion, so radiant with life and so fervently
      intent upon realizing to the full this, the first of its unknown joys. So
      with crashing of chords and thunder of melody the act went on. And when it
      was over, Juliet thought no more of the Cornish sea and the lullaby of the
      waves. A new music was stirring in her young blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in the front row of the gallery, and presently she leaned over
      to gaze down at the panorama below, the women in the boxes and stalls,
      whose bare shoulders and skillfully coiffured hair flashed with jewels.
      Suddenly her hand fell upon Aynesworth&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried in some excitement, &ldquo;do you see who that is in the box
      there&mdash;the one almost next to the stage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth, too, uttered a little exclamation. The lights from beneath
      were falling full upon the still, cold face of the man who had just taken
      a vacant chair in one of the boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and glanced at once at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave Seton,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange that I should see
      him here tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes often,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;Music is one of his few
      weaknesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement in the box, and a woman&rsquo;s head and shoulders appeared
      from behind the curtain. Juliet gave a little gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Aynesworth,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;did you ever see such a beautiful woman?
      Do tell me who she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very great lady in London society,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;That is
      Emily, Marchioness of Westchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliet&rsquo;s eyes never moved from her until the beautiful neck and shoulders
      were turned away. She leaned over towards her companion, and she did not
      again, for some few minutes, face the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the loveliest woman I ever saw in my life,&rdquo; Juliet said with a
      little sigh. &ldquo;Is she a great friend of Sir Wingrave Seton, Mr.
      Aynesworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no friends,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I believe that they are very
      well acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Sir Wingrave!&rdquo; Juliet murmured softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth looked at her in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is odd that you should have recognized him from up here,&rdquo; he remarked
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;He has changed so much during the last few years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliet smiled, but she did not explain. She felt that she was obeying
      Wingrave&rsquo;s wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have recognized him anywhere,&rdquo; she answered simply. &ldquo;I wonder
      what they are talking about. She seems so interested, and he looks so
      bored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth looked at his watch. It was barely ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to see him here this evening,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like so much,&rdquo; she said, still gazing at them earnestly, &ldquo;to
      know that they are talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      &ldquo;So you will not tell me,&rdquo; the Marchioness murmured, ceasing for a moment
      the graceful movements of her fan, and looking at him steadily. &ldquo;You
      refuse me this&mdash;almost the first thing I have ever asked you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is scarcely,&rdquo; Wingrave objected, &ldquo;a reasonable question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between you and me,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;such punctiliousness is scarcely
      necessary&mdash;is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He withstood the attack of those wonderful eyes lifted swiftly to his, and
      answered her gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Lady Ruth&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Probably, therefore, she will
      tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness laughed softly, yet with something less than mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;Lady Ruth and I? There was never a woman in
      this world who was less my friend&mdash;especially now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked for no explanation of her last words, but in a moment or two she
      vouchsafed it. She leaned a little forward, her eyes flashed softly
      through the semi-darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth is afraid,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;that I might take you away from
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;the slight friendship between Lady Ruth and
      myself is not of the nature to engender such a fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her beautiful shoulders. Her hands were toying with the rope
      of pearls which hung from her neck. She bent over them, as though
      examining the color of the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you known Ruth?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her steadfastly. He could not be sure whether it was his
      fancy, or whether indeed there was some hidden meaning in her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I came to live in England,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Then with a little wave of her hands and a
      brilliant smile, she figuratively dismissed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We waste time,&rdquo; she remarked lightly, &ldquo;and we may have callers at any
      moment. I will ask you no more questions save those which the conventions
      may permit you to answer truthfully. We can&rsquo;t depart from our code, can
      we, even for the sake of an inquisitive woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will have no assurances,&rdquo; she interrupted smilingly. &ldquo;I am going to
      talk of other things. I am going to ask you a ridiculous question. Are you
      fond of music?&mdash;seriously!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I sometimes wonder what there is in the world
      that interests you! Certainly, none of the ordinary things seem to.
      Tonight, almost for the first time, I saw you look a little drawn out of
      yourself. I was wondering whether it was the music or the people. I
      suppose, until one gets used to it,&rdquo; she added, looking a little wearily
      around the house, &ldquo;an audience like this is worth looking at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is not the people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you make as close a study
      of all your acquaintances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally not,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and I do not class you amongst my
      acquaintances at all. You interest me, my friend&mdash;very much indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am flattered,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not&mdash;I wish that you were,&rdquo; she answered simply. &ldquo;I can
      understand why you have succeeded where so many others have failed. You
      are strong. You have nerves of steel&mdash;and very little heart. But now&mdash;what
      are you going to do with your life, now that wealth must even have lost
      its meaning to you? I should like to know that. Will you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Eat and drink, and juggle a little with
      the ball of fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not ambitious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasure, for itself, does not attract you. No! I know that it does not.
      What are you going to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you direct me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;if you will pay my price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her more intently. He himself had been attaching no
      particular importance to this conversation, but he was suddenly conscious
      that it was not so with the woman at his side. Her eyes were shining at
      him, soft and full and sweet; her beautiful bosom was rising and falling
      quickly; there had come to her something which even he was forced to
      recognize, that curious and voluptuous abandonment which a woman rarely
      permits herself, and can never assume. He was a little bewildered. His
      speech lost for a moment its cold precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your price?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am stupid. I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry me,&rdquo; she whispered in his ear, &ldquo;and I will take you a little
      further into life than you could ever go alone You don&rsquo;t care for me, of
      course&mdash;but you shall. You don&rsquo;t understand this world, Wingrave, or
      how to make the best of it. I do! Let me be your guide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked at her in grave astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not by any chance&mdash;in earnest?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well that I am,&rdquo; she answered swiftly. &ldquo;And yet you
      hesitate! What is it that you are afraid of? Don&rsquo;t you like to give up
      your liberty? We need not marry unless you choose. That is only a matter
      of form nowadays at any rate. I have a hundred chaperons to choose from.
      Society expects strange things from me. It is your companionship I want.
      Your money is fascinating, of course. I should like to see you spend it,
      to spend it with both hands. Don&rsquo;t be afraid that we should be talked
      about. I am not Lady Ruth! I am Emily, Marchioness of Westchester, and I
      live and choose my friends as I please; will you be chief amongst them?
      Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Wingrave it was providential. The loud chorus which had heralded the
      upraising of the curtain died away. Melba&rsquo;s first few notes were floating
      through the house. Silence was a necessity. The low passion of the music
      rippled from the stage, through the senses and into the hearts of many of
      the listeners. But Wingrave listened silent and unmoved. He was even
      unconscious that the woman by his side was watching him half anxiously
      every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain descended amidst a thunder of applause. Wingrave turned slowly
      towards his companion. And then there came a respite&mdash;a knock at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness frowned, but Wingrave was already holding it open. Lady
      Ruth, followed by an immaculate young guardsman, a relative of her
      husband, was standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wingrave!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly, with upraised eyebrows, &ldquo;why have
      you contrived to render yourself invisible? We thought you were alone,
      Emily,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and took pity on you. And all the time you had a
      prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness looked at Lady Ruth, and Lady Ruth looked at the
      Marchioness. The young guardsman was a little sorry that he had come, but
      Lady Ruth never turned a hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must really have your eyes seen to, dear,&rdquo; the Marchioness remarked
      in a tone of tender concern. &ldquo;When you can&rsquo;t see such an old friend as Mr.
      Wingrave from a few yards away, they must be very bad indeed. How are you,
      Captain Kendrick? Come and tell me about the polo this afternoon. Sorry I
      can&rsquo;t offer you all chairs. This is an absurd box&mdash;it was only meant
      for two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into ours,&rdquo; Lady Ruth said; &ldquo;we have chairs for six, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had a millionaire in the family,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;All the same, I
      hate large parties. I am old-fashioned enough to think that two is a
      delightful number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth laid her hand upon Wingrave&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A decided hint, Mr. Wingrave,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Come and let me introduce
      you to my sister. Our box is only a few yards off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      &ldquo;I AM MISANTHROPOS, AND HATE MANKIND&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Wingrave had just come in from an early gallop. His pale cheeks were
      slightly flushed, and his eyes were bright. He had been riding hard to
      escape from disconcerting thoughts. He looked in at the study, and found
      Aynesworth with a mass of correspondence before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything important?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;The letters marked private I have sent up
      to your room. By the bye, there was something I wanted to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was up in the gallery of the Opera House last night,&rdquo; Aynesworth said,
      &ldquo;with a&mdash;person who saw you only once, soon after I first came to you&mdash;before
      America. You were some distance away, and yet&mdash;my friend recognized
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, of course, is possible,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It really does not matter so
      very much unless they knew me&mdash;as Wingrave Seton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; Aynesworth said, &ldquo;recognized you as Sir Wingrave Seton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave frowned thoughtfully for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most unlikely person,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked smiling. &ldquo;Do you remember,
      when we went down to Tredowen just before we left for America, a little,
      long-legged, black-frocked child, whom we met in the gardens&mdash;the
      organist&rsquo;s daughter, you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of her?&rdquo; Wingrave asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was she who was with me,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked. &ldquo;It was she who saw you
      in the box with the Marchioness of Westchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth was puzzled by the intentness with which Wingrave was regarding
      him. Impenetrable though the man was, Aynesworth, who had not yet lost his
      early trick of studying him closely, knew that, for some reason or other,
      his intelligence had proved disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you then&mdash;kept up your acquaintance with this child?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not a child any longer, but a very beautiful young woman,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I met her again quite by accident. She is up in London, studying
      art at the studio of an old friend of mine who has a class of girls. I
      called to see him the other afternoon, and recognized her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your acquaintance,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;has progressed rapidly if she
      accepts your escort&mdash;to the gallery of the Opera!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was scarcely like that,&rdquo; Aynesworth explained. &ldquo;I met her and Mrs.
      Tresfarwin on the way there, and asked to be allowed to accompany them.
      Mrs. Tresfarwin was once your housekeeper, I think, at Tredowen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you solve the mystery of this relation of her father who turned
      up so opportunely?&rdquo; Wingrave asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me nothing about him,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave passed on to his own room. His breakfast was on the table
      awaiting him, and a little pile of letters and newspapers stood by his
      plate. His servant, his head groom, and his chauffeur were there to
      receive their orders for the morning. About him were all the evidences of
      his well-ordered life. He sent both the men away and locked the door. It
      was half an hour before he touched either his breakfast or his letters....
    </p>
    <p>
      He lunched at Westchester House in obedience to a somewhat imperative
      summons. There were other guests there, whom, however, he outstayed. As
      soon as they were alone, his hostess touched him on the arm and led him to
      her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with an air of real relief. &ldquo;There, sit down
      opposite to me, please&mdash;I want to watch your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was a little paler than usual, and he noticed that she had avoided
      talking much to him at luncheon time. And yet he thought that he had never
      seen her more beautiful. Something in her face had altered. He could not
      tell what it was for he was not a man of much experience as regarded her
      sex. Yet, in a vague sort of way, he understood the change. A certain part
      of the almost insolent quietness, the complete self-assurance of her
      manner, had gone. She was a little more like an ordinary woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth proved herself an excellent tactician last night,&rdquo; she
      remarked. &ldquo;She has given me an exceedingly uncomfortable few hours. For
      you, well for you it was a respite, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I should call it exactly that,&rdquo; he answered
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him steadfastly, almost wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am not going to make excuses for myself. But the
      things which one says naturally enough when the emotions provoke them
      sound crude enough in cold blood and colder daylight. We women are
      creatures of mood, you know. I was feeling a little lonely and a little
      tired last night, and the music stole away my common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;All that you said shall be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not understand,&rdquo; she answered, smiling at him. &ldquo;What I said I
      do not wish to be forgotten. Only&mdash;just at that moment, it sounded
      natural enough&mdash;and today&mdash;I think that I am a little ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his seat. Her eyes leaped up to his expectantly, and the
      color streamed into her cheeks. But he only stood by her side. He did
      nothing to meet the half-proffered embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lady Emily,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all the kind things that you said were spoken
      to a stranger. You did not know me. I did not mean anyone to know me. It
      is you who have commanded the truth. You must have it. I am not the person
      I seem to be. I am not the person to whom words such as yours should have
      been spoken. Even my name is an assumed one. I should prefer to leave it
      at that&mdash;if you are content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not content,&rdquo; she answered quietly; &ldquo;I must hear more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who spent ten years in prison, the ten best years
      of my life. A woman sent me there&mdash;a woman swore my liberty away to
      save her reputation. I was never of a forgiving disposition, I was never
      an amiably disposed person. I want you to understand this. Any of the
      ordinary good qualities with which the average man may be endowed, and
      which I may have possessed, are as dead in me as hell fire could burn
      them. You have spoken of me as of a man who failed to find a sufficient
      object in life. You were wrong. I have an object, and I do my best to live
      up to it. I hate the whole world of men and women who laughed their way
      through life whilst I suffered&mdash;tortures. I hate the woman who sent
      me there. I have no heart, nor any sense of pity. Now perhaps you can
      understand my life and the manner of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were clasped to the side of her head. Something of horror had
      stolen into the steadfast gaze with which she was still regarding him. Yet
      there were other things there which puzzled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;is terrible!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Then you are not&mdash;Mr.
      Wingrave at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. After all, it was scarcely worth while concealing anything
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Sir Wingrave Seton,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may remember my little affair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught hold of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor, poor dear!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How you must have suffered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave had a terrible moment. What he felt he would never have admitted,
      even to himself. Her eyes were shining with sympathy, and it was so
      unexpected. He had expected something in the nature of a cold withdrawal;
      her silence was the only thing he had counted upon. It was a fierce, but
      short battle. His sudden grasp of her hands was relaxed. He stood away
      from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As you can doubtless imagine, it is a
      little too late for sympathy. The years have gone, and the better part of
      me, if ever there was a better part, with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were absolutely heartless,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you were perfectly
      consistent, why did you not make me suffer? You had a great chance! A
      little feigned affection, and then a few truths. You could have dragged me
      down a little way into the pit of broken hearts! Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is forced to neglect a few opportunities!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him&mdash;delightfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You foolish man!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Some day or other, you will turn out to
      be a terrible impostor. Do you know, I think I am going to ask you again&mdash;what
      I asked you last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely think that you will be so ill-advised,&rdquo; he declared coldly.
      &ldquo;Whether you believe it or not, I can assure you that I am incapable of
      affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure about that,&rdquo; she said with protesting eyebrows, &ldquo;but you
      are terribly hard-hearted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was entirely dissatisfied with the impression he had produced. He
      considered the attitude of the Marchioness unjustifiably frivolous. He had
      an uneasy conviction that she was not in the least inclined to take him
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the clock, &ldquo;that I need detain you
      any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really going away, then?&rdquo; she asked him softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To call on Lady Ruth, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it happens, no,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly her face changed&mdash;she had remembered something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Lady Ruth!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a triumph of inconsistency!&rdquo; she declared scornfully. &ldquo;You are
      lending them money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lending money to Lady Ruth,&rdquo; he answered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. She understood, at any rate, what he intended to convey.
      Certainly his expression was hard and merciless enough now!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ruth,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you will probably say that in earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      JULIET GAINS EXPERIENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Juliet said, &ldquo;after Tredowen it seems very small, almost
      poky, but it isn&rsquo;t, really, and Tredowen was not for me all my days. It
      was quite time I got used to something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave looked around him with expressionless face. It was a tiny room,
      high up on the fifth floor of a block of flats, prettily but inexpensively
      furnished. Juliet herself, tall and slim, with all the fire of youth and
      perfect health on her young face, was obviously contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your work?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a good deal to unlearn,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but Mr. Pleydell is very kind
      and encouraging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go down to Cornwall for the hot weather, I hope?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;London is unbearable in August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The class are going for a sketching tour to Normandy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and Mr.
      Pleydell thought that I might like to join them. It is very inexpensive,
      and I should be able to go on with my work all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have met Mr. Aynesworth again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it delightful?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He is quite an old friend of Mr.
      Pleydell. I was so glad to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;you are a little lonely sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be when I get to know the girls
      in the class a little better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some friends,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;women, of course, who would
      come and see you with pleasure. And yet,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am not sure that
      you would not be better off without knowing them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are fashionable ladies, perhaps?&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They belong to the Juggernaut here which is called society. They would
      probably try to draw you a little way into its meshes. I think, yes, I am
      sure,&rdquo; he added, looking at her, &ldquo;that you are better off outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am quite sure of it,&rdquo; she answered laughing. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the clothes
      or the time or the inclination for that sort of thing. Besides, I am going
      to be much too happy ever to be lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;am not an impressionable person. But they tell me
      that most people, especially of your age, find London a terribly lonely
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand that,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;unless they really had something
      definite to do. I have felt a little of that myself. I think London
      frightens me a little. It is so different from the country, and there is a
      great deal that is difficult to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great number of poor people who find it so hard to live,&rdquo; she
      answered. &ldquo;Some of the small houses round here are awful, and Mr. Malcolm&mdash;he
      is the vicar of the church here, and he called yesterday&mdash;tells me
      that they are nothing like so bad as in some other parts of London. And
      then you take a bus, it is such a short distance&mdash;and the shops are
      full of wonderful things at such fabulous prices, and the carriages and
      houses are so lovely, and people seem to be showering money right and left
      everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same in all large cities,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;more or less. There
      must always be rich and poor, when a great community are herded together.
      As a rule, the extreme poor are a worthless lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some of them, though,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;who deserve to have a
      better time. Of course, I have never been outside Tredowen, where everyone
      was contented and happy in their way, and it seems terrible to me just at
      first. I can&rsquo;t bear to think that everyone hasn&rsquo;t at least a chance of
      happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too young,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to bother your head about these things yet.
      Wait until you have gathered in a little philosophy with the years. Then
      you will understand how helpless you are to alter by ever so little the
      existing state of things, and it will trouble you less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;may, of course, be helpless, but what about those
      people who have huge fortunes, and still do nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should they?&rdquo; he answered coldly. &ldquo;This is a world for individual
      effort. No man is strong enough to carry even a single one of his fellows
      upon his shoulders. Charity is the most illogical and pernicious of all
      weaknesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are laughing at me,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I mean men like that Mr.
      Wingrave, the American who has come to England to spend all his millions.
      I have just been reading about him,&rdquo; she added, pointing to an illustrated
      paper on the table. &ldquo;They say that his income is too vast to be put into
      figures which would sound reasonable; that he has estates and shooting
      properties, and a yacht which he has never yet even seen. And yet he will
      not give one penny away. He gives nothing to the hospitals, nothing to the
      poor. He spends his money on himself, and himself alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not prepared to defend my namesake,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but every man has a
      right to do what he likes with his own, hasn&rsquo;t he? And as for hospitals,
      Mr. Wingrave probably thinks, like a good many more, that they should be
      state endowed. People could make use of them, then, without loss of self
      respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head a little doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue about it yet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I haven&rsquo;t thought about
      it long enough. But I know if I had all the money this man has, I couldn&rsquo;t
      be happy to spend thousands and thousands upon myself while there were
      people almost starving in the same city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a sentimentalist, you see,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and you have not
      studied the laws on which society is based. Tell me, how does Mrs.
      Tresfarwin like London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliet laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it amusing?&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;She loves it! She grumbles at the milk,
      and we have the butter from Tredowen. Everything else she finds
      perfection. She doesn&rsquo;t even mind the five flights of stone steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Social problems,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked, &ldquo;do not trouble her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Juliet declared. &ldquo;She spends all her pennies on
      beggars and omnibus rides, and she is perfectly happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave rose to go in a few minutes. Juliet walked with him to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to be really hospitable,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I am going to walk
      with you to the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All down those five flights?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They commenced the descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something about a flat,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;which makes one horribly
      curious about one&rsquo;s neighbors&mdash;especially if one has never had any.
      All these closed doors may hide no end of interesting people, and I have
      never seen a soul go in or out. How did you like all this climbing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t appreciate it,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you won&rsquo;t come to see me again, then?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I hope you
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; he said a little stiffly, &ldquo;with pleasure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were on the ground floor, and Juliet opened the door. Wingrave&rsquo;s
      motor was outside, and the man touched his hat. She gave a little
      breathless cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t yours?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Do you want to come and look at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have never seen one close to in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you a little way, if you like,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks were pink with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I like! And I&rsquo;ve never been in one before! I&rsquo;ll fly up for my hat. I
      sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was already halfway up the first flight of stairs, with a whirl of
      skirts and flying feet. Wingrave lit a cigarette and stood for a moment
      thoughtfully upon the pavement. Then he shrugged his shoulders. His face
      had grown a little harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must take her chances,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;No one knows her. Nobody is
      likely to find out who she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was down again in less time than seemed possible. Her cheeks were
      flushed and her eyes bright with excitement. Wingrave took the wheel
      himself, and she sat up by his side. They glided off almost noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go up to the Park,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is just the time to see the
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;This is too lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed from Battersea northwards into Piccadilly, and down into the
      Park. Juliet was too excited to talk; Wingrave had enough to do to drive
      the car. They passed plenty of people who bowed, and many who glanced with
      wondering admiration at the beautiful girl who sat by Wingrave&rsquo;s side.
      Lady Ruth, who drive by quickly in a barouche, almost rose from her seat;
      the Marchioness, whose victoria they passed, had time to wave her hand and
      flash a quick, searching glance at Juliet, who returned it with her dark
      eyes filled with admiration. The Marchioness smiled to herself a little
      sadly as the car shot away ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one asked,&rdquo; she murmured to herself, &ldquo;he would try to persuade one
      that it was another victim.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      NEMESIS AT WORK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wingrave was present that evening at a reception given by the Prime
      Minister to some distinguished foreign guests. He had scarcely exchanged
      the usual courtesies with his host and hostess before Lady Ruth, leaning
      over from a little group, whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take me away. I am bored. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused at once. Lady Ruth nodded to her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wingrave is going to take me to hear Melba sing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;See you
      all again, I suppose, at Hereford House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made slow progress through the crowded rooms. Once or twice Wingrave
      fancied that his companion hung a little heavily upon his arm. She showed
      no desire to talk. She even answered a remark of his in a monosyllable.
      Only when they passed the Marchioness, on the arm of one of the foreign
      guests in whose honor the reception was given, she seemed to shiver a
      little, and her grasp upon his arm was tightened. Once, in a block, she
      was forced to speak to some acquaintances, and during those few seconds,
      Wingrave studied her curiously. She was absolutely colorless, and her
      strange brilliant eyes seemed to have lost all their fire. Her gown was
      black, and the decorations of her hair were black except for a single
      diamond. There was something almost spectral about her appearance. She
      walked stiffly&mdash;for the moment she had lost the sinuous grace of
      movement which had been one of her many fascinations. Her neck and
      shoulders alone remained, as ever, dazzlingly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached a quiet corner at last. Lady Ruth sank with a little gesture
      of relief into an easy chair. Wingrave stood before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired tonight,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always tired,&rdquo; she answered wearily. &ldquo;I begin to think that I always
      shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing. Lady Ruth closed her eyes for a moment as though from
      sheer fatigue. Suddenly she opened them again and looked him full in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child you were with&mdash;the ingenue, you know&mdash;with the pink
      cheeks and the wonderful eyes! Is she from one of the theaters, or a
      genuine article?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady to whom you refer,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is the daughter of an
      old friend of mine. I am practically her guardian. She is in London
      studying painting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are her guardian?&rdquo; Lady Ruth repeated. &ldquo;I am sorry for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I trust that I shall be able to fulfill
      my duties in a perfectly satisfactory manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I have no doubt of it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Yet I am sorry for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certainly,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;not in an amiable mood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in rather a desperate one if that is anything,&rdquo; she said, looking at
      him with something of the old light in her tired eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a little error, perhaps, in those calculations?&rdquo; he suggested.
      &ldquo;It can be amended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a brute,&rdquo; she answered fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds a little severe,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take any notice of anything I say tonight,&rdquo; she murmured softly. &ldquo;I
      am a little mad. I think that everything is going against me! I know that
      you haven&rsquo;t a grain of sympathy for me&mdash;that you would rather see me
      suffer than not, and yet you see I give myself away entirely. Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t I? Part of it is through you in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather fancied,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that up to now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Of course!&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;you saved me from ruin, staved it off
      at any rate. And you held over the reckoning! I&mdash;I almost wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Again her eyes were searching his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a little tired of it all, you see,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
      Lumley and I can ever be the same again since I brought him&mdash;that
      check. He avoids being alone with me&mdash;I do the same with him. One
      would think&mdash;to watch the people, that the whole transaction was in
      the Morning Post. They smile when they see us together, they grin when
      they see you with anybody else. It&rsquo;s getting hateful, Wingrave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;that you are in a nervous, hypersensitive
      state. No one else can possibly know of the little transaction between us,
      and, so far as I am concerned, there has been nothing to interfere with
      your relations with your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am losing my nerve. I am only afraid
      that I am losing something else. I haven&rsquo;t an ounce of battle left in me.
      I feel that I should like to close my eyes and wake up in a new world, and
      start all over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing but a mood,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;Those new worlds don&rsquo;t exist
      any longer. They generally consist of foreign watering places where the
      sheep and the goats house together now and then. I think I should play the
      game out, Lady Ruth, until&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps to the end,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Who can tell? Not I! By this time
      tomorrow, it might be I who would be reminding you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there are other worlds, and other lives to live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; she whispered very softly, &ldquo;to hear of them. But I fancy
      somehow that you will never be my instructor. What of your ward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! What of her?&rdquo; he answered calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very frank with me once, Wingrave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are a man
      whose life fate has wrecked, fate and I! You have no heart left, no
      feeling. You can create suffering and find it amusing. I am beginning to
      realize that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some truth,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;In what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that child? Is she, too, to be a victim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that you are not going to be melodramatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it that. I really want to know. I should like to warn her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at war with children,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Her life and mine are as
      far apart as the poles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had an odd fancy when I saw you with her,&rdquo; Lady Ruth said slowly. &ldquo;She
      is very good-looking&mdash;and not so absurdly young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fancy was one,&rdquo; he remarked coldly, &ldquo;which I think you had better get
      rid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way,&rdquo; she continued thoughtfully, &ldquo;I should like to get rid of it,
      and yet&mdash;how old are you, Wingrave? Well, I know. You are very little
      over forty. You are barely in the prime of life, you are strong, you have
      the one thing which society today counts almost divine&mdash;great,
      immeasurable wealth! Can&rsquo;t you find someone to thaw the snows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved a woman once,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It was a long time ago, and it seems
      strange to me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth lifted her eyes to his, and their lambent fires were suddenly
      rekindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love her again,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;What is past is past, but there are the
      days to come! Perhaps the woman, too, is a little lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he answered calmly. &ldquo;The woman is married, she has lived
      with her husband more or less happily for a dozen years or so! She is a
      little ambitious, a little fond of pleasure, but a leader of society, and,
      I am sure, a very reputable member of it. To love her again would be as
      embarrassing to her&mdash;as it would be difficult for me. You, my dear
      Lady Ruth, I am convinced, would be the last to approve of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mock me,&rdquo; she murmured, bending her head. &ldquo;Is forgiveness also an
      impossibility?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that any sentiment whatever between those two would
      be singularly misplaced. You spoke of Melba, I think! She is singing in
      the further room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth rose up, still and pale. There was fear in her eyes when she
      looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it to be always like this, then?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am no prophet. Who can tell what the days may bring?
      In the meantime...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness was very much in request that evening, and she found time
      for only a few words with Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing to poor Ruth?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I never saw her look
      so ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I had not noticed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know her better,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;I might begin to suspect her
      of a conscience. Whose baby were you driving about this afternoon? I
      didn&rsquo;t know that your taste ran to ingenues to such an extent. She&rsquo;s
      sweetly pretty, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s nice of you to flaunt her before us
      middle-aged people. It&rsquo;s enough to drive us to the rouge box. Come to
      lunch tomorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; he answered, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or so later, on his way out, he came upon Lady Ruth sitting a
      little forlornly in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether I dare ask you to drop me in Cadogan Square?&rdquo; she asked.
      &ldquo;Is it much out of your way? I am leaving a little earlier than I
      expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; he answered, offering his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed out of the door and down the covered way into the street. A
      few stragglers were loitering on the pavement, and one, a tall, thin young
      man in a long ulster, bent forwards as they came down the steps. Wingrave
      felt his companion&rsquo;s grasp tighten upon his arm; a flash of light upon the
      pale features and staring eyes of the young man a few feet off, showed him
      to be in the act of intercepting them. Then, at a sharp word from
      Wingrave, a policeman stretched out his arm. The young man was pushed
      unceremoniously away. Wingrave&rsquo;s tall footman and the policeman formed an
      impassable barrier&mdash;in a moment the electric brougham was gliding
      down the street. Lady Ruth was leaning back amongst the cushions, and the
      hand which fell suddenly upon Wingrave&rsquo;s was cold as ice!

    <h2>
      RICHARDSON TRIES AGAIN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;You saw&mdash;who that was?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth&rsquo;s voice seemed to come from a greater distance. Wingrave turned
      and looked at her with calm curiosity. She was leaning back in the corner
      of the carriage, and she seemed somehow to have shrunk into an unusual
      insignificance. Her eyes alone were clearly visible through the
      semi-darkness&mdash;and the light which shone from their depths was the
      light of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered slowly, &ldquo;I believe that I recognized him. It was the
      young man who persists in some strange hallucination as to a certain
      Mademoiselle Violet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no hallucination,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You know that! I was
      Mademoiselle Violet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It amazes me,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;that you should have stooped to
      such folly. That my demise would have been a relief to you I can, of
      course, easily believe, but the means&mdash;they surely were not worthy of
      your ingenuity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried sharply. &ldquo;I must have been utterly, miserably mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the greatest of schemers have their wild moments,&rdquo; he remarked
      consolingly. &ldquo;This was one of yours. You paid me a very poor compliment,
      by the bye, to imagine that an insignificant creature like that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you&mdash;leave off?&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; he continued after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;that you find him now
      quite an inconvenient person to deal with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am paying for my folly, if that is what you mean,&rdquo; she declared.
      &ldquo;He knows&mdash;who I am&mdash;that he was deceived. He follows me about&mdash;everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave glanced out of the carriage window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I am very much surprised,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;he is following us now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came a little closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t leave me? Promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see you home,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are coming on to Hereford House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I have had enough of society for one
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily will be there later,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even Lady Emily,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;will not tempt me. I will see you safely
      inside. Afterwards, if your persistent follower is hanging about, I will
      endeavor to talk him into a more reasonable frame of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment. Then she turned to him abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are more kind to me sometimes than I deserve, Wingrave,&rdquo; she
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not kindness,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I dislike absurd situations. Here we
      are! Permit me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave kept his word. He saw Lady Ruth to her front door, and then
      turned back towards his carriage. Standing by the side of the footman, a
      little breathless, haggard and disheveled-looking, was the young man who
      had attempted to check their progress a few minutes ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave took hold of his arm firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in there,&rdquo; he ordered, pointing to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man tried to escape, but he was held as though in a vise. Before
      he well knew where he was, he was in the carriage, and Wingrave was seated
      by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know what you mean by following that lady about?&rdquo; Wingrave
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man leaned forward. His hand was upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get out,&rdquo; he said sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure&mdash;presently,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I can assure you that
      I am not anxious to detain you longer than necessary. Only you must first
      answer my question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to her! I shall follow her about until I can!&rdquo; the young
      man declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave glanced at him with a faint derisive smile. His clothes were worn
      and shabby, he was badly in need of a shave and a wash. He sat hunched up
      in a corner of the carriage, the picture of mute discomfort and misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who she is?&rdquo; Wingrave asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Violet!&rdquo; the young man answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;She is Lady Ruth Barrington, wife
      of Lumley Barrington and daughter of the Earl of Haselton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is Mademoiselle Violet,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coupe drew up before the great block of buildings in which was
      Wingrave&rsquo;s flat. The footman threw open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in with me,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;I have something more to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather not,&rdquo; the young man muttered, and would have slouched off,
      but Wingrave caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said firmly, and the youth obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave led the way into his sitting room and dismissed his servant who
      was setting out a tray upon the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he ordered, and his strange guest again obeyed. Wingrave
      looked at him critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;that you are another of those
      poor fools who chuck away their life and happiness and go to the dogs
      because a woman had chosen to make a little use of them. You&rsquo;re out of
      work, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave brought a plate of sandwiches from the sideboard, and mixed a
      whisky and soda. He set them down in front of his guest, and turned away
      with the evening paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going into the next room for some cigarettes,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone scarcely two minutes. When he returned, the room was in
      darkness. He moved suddenly towards the electric lights, but was pushed
      back by an unseen hand. A man&rsquo;s hot breath fell upon his cheek, a hoarse,
      rasping voice spoke to him out of the black shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch the lights! Don&rsquo;t touch the lights, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What folly is this?&rdquo; Wingrave asked angrily. &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; came the quick answer. &ldquo;I have been. It has come to me here, in
      the darkness. I know why she is angry, I know why she will not speak to
      me. It is&mdash;because I failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave laughed, and moved towards the lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had enough of this tomfoolery,&rdquo; he said scornfully. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t
      listen to reason&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He never finished his sentence. He had stumbled suddenly against a soft
      body, he had a momentary impression of a white, vicious face, of eyes
      blazing with insane fury. Quick to act, he struck&mdash;but before his
      hand descended, he had felt the tearing of his shirt, the sharp, keen pain
      in his chest, the swimming of his senses. Yet even then he struck again
      with passionate anger, and his assailant went down amongst the chairs with
      a dull, sickening crash!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was silence in the room. Wingrave made an effort to drag
      himself a yard or two towards the bell, but collapsed hopelessly.
      Richardson, in a few moments, staggered to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He groped his way to the side of the wall, and found the knobs of the
      electric lights. He turned two on and looked around him. Wingrave was
      lying a few yards off, with a small red stain upon his shirt front. His
      face was ghastly pale, and he was breathing thickly. The young man looked
      at him for several moments, and then made his way to the side table where
      the sandwiches were. One by one he took them from the dish, and ate
      deliberately. When he had finished, he made his way once more towards
      where Wingrave lay. But before he reached the spot, he stopped short.
      Something on the wall had attracted his attention. He put his hand to his
      head and thought for a moment. It was an idea&mdash;a glorious idea.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      Lady Ruth&rsquo;s maid stepped back and surveyed her mistress ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milady,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;has never, no never, appeared more charming. The
      gown, it is divine&mdash;and the coiffure! Milady will have no rivals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth looked at herself long and earnestly in the glass. Her face
      reflected none of the pleased interest with which her maid was still
      regarding her. The latter grew a little anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milady thinks herself a trifle pale, perhaps&mdash;a little more color?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth set down the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Annette,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I shall do very well, I suppose.
      Certainly, I won&rsquo;t have any rouge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milady knows very well what becomes her,&rdquo; the woman answered discreetly.
      &ldquo;The pallor, it is the more distinguished. Milady cannot fail to have all
      the success she desires!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth smiled a little wearily. And at that moment, there came a knock
      at the door. A servant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone wishes to speak to your ladyship on the telephone,&rdquo; the girl
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the telephone, at this time of night?&rdquo; Lady Ruth exclaimed.
      &ldquo;Ridiculous! They must send a message, whoever they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parkins told them so, your ladyship,&rdquo; the girl answered; &ldquo;but they
      insisted that the matter was important. They would give no name, but said
      that they were speaking from Mr. Wingrave&rsquo;s rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very extraordinary,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;but I will come to the
      telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      &ldquo;IT WAS AN ACCIDENT&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth took up the receiver. Some instinct seemed to have prompted her
      to close the door of the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Who is it that wants me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thin, unfamiliar voice answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Lady Ruth Barrington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;Mademoiselle Violet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The receiver nearly dropped from her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am Lady Ruth Barrington! Who
      are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Mademoiselle Violet,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;and you know who I am!
      Listen, I am in Mr. Wingrave&rsquo;s rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would have liked to have rung off and gone away, but it seemed a sheer
      impossibility for her to move! And all the time her knees were shaking,
      and the fear of evil things was in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He brought me in himself,&rdquo; the thin voice answered. &ldquo;Can you hear me? I
      don&rsquo;t want to speak any louder for fear anyone else should be listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can hear,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But how dared you ring me up? Say what
      you desire to quickly! I am going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, please,&rdquo; the voice answered. &ldquo;I know why you have been angry with
      me. I know why you have kept away from me, why you have been so cruel! It
      was because I failed. Was it not, dear Mademoiselle Violet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not the breath or the courage to answer him. In a moment or two he
      continued, and there was a note of suppressed exultation in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! This time&mdash;I have not failed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nearly screamed. The receiver in her hand burned like a live thing.
      Her eyes were set in a fixed and awful stare as though she were trying to
      see for herself outside the walls of the little room where she stood into
      the larger chamber from which the voice&mdash;that awful voice&mdash;came!
      Her own words were hysterical and uncertain, but she managed to falter
      them out at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Where is Mr. Wingrave? Tell me at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice, without being raised, seemed to take to itself a note of
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dying&mdash;on the floor&mdash;just here! Listen hard! Perhaps you
      can hear him groan! Now will you believe that I am not a coward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her shriek drowned his words. She flung the receiver from her with a crash
      and rushed from the room into the hall. She brushed past her maid with a
      wild gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my wraps. Open the door, Parkins! Is the carriage waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Milady! Shall&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was past him and down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 18, Grosvenor Mansions,&rdquo; she cried to the man. &ldquo;Drive fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man obeyed. The servants, who had come to the door, stood there a
      little frightened group. She ignored them and everything else completely.
      The carriage had scarcely stopped when she sprang out and crossed the
      pavement in a few hasty steps. The tall commissionaire looked in amazement
      at her. She wore an opera cloak&mdash;she was a bewildering vision of
      white satin and diamonds, and her eyes were terrible with the fear which
      was in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clutched him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up with me to Mr. Wingrave&rsquo;s rooms,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Something
      terrible has happened. I heard through the telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man dashed up the stairs by her side. Wingrave&rsquo;s suite was on the
      first floor, and they did not wait for the lift. The commissionaire put
      his finger on the bell of the outside door. She leaned forward, listening
      breathlessly. Inside all was silence except for the shrill clamor of the
      bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on ringing,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at her curiously. &ldquo;Mr. Wingrave came in about an hour ago
      with a young man, madam,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Listen! There&rsquo;s someone coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard a hesitating step inside. The door was cautiously opened. It
      was Richardson, pale, disheveled, but triumphant, who peered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle&mdash;Mademoiselle Violet,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You have come to see
      for yourself. This way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her arm and struck him across the face so that, with a little
      moan, he staggered back against the wall. Then she hastened forward into
      the room towards which he had pointed and the door of which stood open.
      The commissionaire followed her. The servants were beginning to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was in darkness save for one electric light. A groan, however,
      directed them. She fell on her knees by Wingrave&rsquo;s prostrate figure and
      raised his head slightly. His servant, too, was hurrying forward. She
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me some brandy,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;Send someone for a doctor. Don&rsquo;t let
      that young man escape. The brandy, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She forced some between his lips. There was already a spot of blood upon
      the gown which, a few minutes ago, had seemed so immaculate. One of the
      ornaments fell from her hair. It lay unnoticed by her side. Suddenly
      Wingrave opened his eyes. She saw at once that he was conscious and that
      he recognized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, please,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It will be better for you not to speak.
      The doctor will be here directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I am much hurt,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Your young friend
      was a born bungler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;did you get here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brute&mdash;telephoned. Please don&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor arrived. His examination was over in a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing serious,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The knife was pretty blunt fortunately.
      How did it happen? It seems like a case for the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an accident,&rdquo; Wingrave declared coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shrugged his shoulders. He was busy making bandages. Lady Ruth
      rose to her feet. She was white and giddy. The commissionaire and Morrison
      were talking together at the door. The latter turned to Lady Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that we had better send for the police, your ladyship?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;It was the young man who came in with Mr. Wingrave who must have
      done this! I thought he was a very wild-looking sort of person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard what Mr. Wingrave said,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I
      should disobey him, if I were you. The doctor says that, after all, it is
      not very serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t have got far,&rdquo; the hall porter remarked. &ldquo;He only slipped out as
      we came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should let him go for the present,&rdquo; Lady Ruth said. &ldquo;If Mr. Wingrave
      wishes to prosecute afterwards, it will be easy for him to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped back to where Wingrave lay. He was in a recumbent position now
      and, although a little pale, he was obviously not seriously hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is nothing else that I can do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will go now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I am exceedingly obliged to you for
      your kindness,&rdquo; he added a little stiffly. &ldquo;Morrison, show Lady Barrington
      to her carriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke a few conventional words of farewell and departed. Outside on
      the pavement she stood for a moment, looking carefully around. There was
      no sign of Richardson anywhere! She stepped into the carriage and leaned
      back in the corner.

    <h2>
      AYNESWORTH PLANS A LOVE STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wingrave disappeared suddenly from London. Aynesworth alone knew where he
      was gone, and he was pledged to secrecy. Two people received letters from
      him. Lady Ruth was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she remarked quietly, handing it over to her husband, &ldquo;may
      interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He adjusted his eye glasses and read it aloud:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lady Ruth,&mdash;I am leaving London today for several weeks. With
      the usual inconsistency of the person to whom life is by no means a
      valuable asset, I am obeying the orders of my physician. I regret,
      therefore, that I cannot have the pleasure of entertaining your husband
      and yourself during Cowes week. The yacht, however, is entirely at your
      disposal, and I have written Captain Masterton to that effect. Pray extend
      your cruise, if you feel inclined to.&mdash;I remain, yours sincerely, W.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barrington looked at his wife inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to me entirely satisfactory, Ruth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think that he
      might have added a word or two of acknowledgment for what you did for him.
      There is no doubt that, but for your promptness, things might have gone
      much worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lady Ruth said slowly, &ldquo;I think that he might have added a few
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband regarded her critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that all this anxiety has knocked you up a
      little. You are not looking well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am tired,&rdquo; she answered calmly. &ldquo;It has been a long season. I should
      like to do what Wingrave has done&mdash;go away somewhere and rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington laid his hand upon hers affectionately. It seemed to him that
      the rings hung a little loosely upon the thin, white fingers. She was
      pale, too, and her eyes were weary. He did not notice that, as soon as she
      could, she drew her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pon my word,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish we could go off somewhere by ourselves.
      But with Wingrave&rsquo;s yacht to entertain on, we must do something for a few
      of the people. I don&rsquo;t suppose he minds whom we ask, or how many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I do not suppose he cares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most opportune,&rdquo; Barrington declared. &ldquo;I wanted particularly to do
      something for the Hendersons. He seems very well disposed, and his
      influence means everything just now. Really, Ruth, I believe we are going
      to pull through after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a little wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, Lumley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it, Ruth,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I only wish I could see you a
      little more cheerful. Surely you can&rsquo;t still&mdash;be afraid of Wingrave,&rdquo;
       he added, glancing uneasily across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I am,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am afraid of him. I have
      always been afraid. Nothing has happened to change him. He came back to
      have his revenge. He will have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lumley Barrington, for once, felt himself superior to his clever wife. He
      smiled upon her reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ruth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if only you would reflect for a few moments, I
      feel sure you would realize the absurdity of such fancies. We did Wingrave
      a service in introducing him to society here, and I am sure that he
      appreciated it. If he wished for our ruin, why did he lend us eight
      thousand pounds on no security? Why does he lend us his yacht to entertain
      our friends? Why did he give me that information which enabled me to make
      the only money I ever did make on the Stock Exchange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand a man like Wingrave,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Nothing that
      he has done is inconsistent with my point of view. He gave you a safe tip,
      knowing very well that when you had won a little, you would try again on
      your own account and lose&mdash;which you did. He lent us the money to
      become our creditor; and he lends us the yacht to give another handle to
      the people who are saying already that he occupies the position in our
      family which is more fully recognized on the other side of the Channel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are talking rubbish,&rdquo; he declared vehemently. &ldquo;No one would dare to
      say such a thing of you&mdash;of my wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed unmercifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were not my husband,&rdquo; she said cruelly, &ldquo;you would have heard it
      before now. I have been careful all my life&mdash;more careful than most
      women, but I can hear the whisperings already. There are more ways to ruin
      than one, Lumley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will refuse the yacht,&rdquo; Barrington said sullenly, &ldquo;and I will go to
      the Jews for that eight thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Lady Ruth answered. &ldquo;I am not going to
      be a laughing stock for Emily and her friends if I can help it. We&rsquo;ll play
      the game through now! Only&mdash;it is best for you to know the risks...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave&rsquo;s second letter was to Juliet. She found it on her table one
      afternoon when she came back from her painting class. She tore it open
      eagerly enough, but her face clouded over as she read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Juliet,&mdash;I am sorry that I am unable to carry out my promise to
      come and see you, but I have been slightly indisposed for some days, and
      am leaving London, for the present, almost at once. I trust that you are
      still interested in your work, and will enjoy your trip to Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received your letter, asking for my help towards re-establishing in
      life a poor family in whom you are interested. I regret that I cannot
      accede to your request. It is wholly against my principles to give money
      away to people of this class. I look upon all charity as a mischievous
      attempt to tamper with natural laws, and I am convinced that if everyone
      shared my views, society would long ago have been re-established on a
      sounder and more logical basis. To be quite frank with you, also, I might
      add that the gift of sympathy has been denied to me. I am quite
      indifferent whether the family you allude to starve or prosper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as you yourself are concerned, however, the matter is entirely
      different. If it gives you pleasure to assist in pauperizing any number of
      your fellow creatures, pray do so. I enclose a check for L100. It is a
      present to you. Use it entirely as you please&mdash;only, if you use it
      for the purpose suggested in your letter to me, remember that the
      responsibility is yours, and yours alone.&mdash;I remain, sincerely yours,
      Wingrave Seton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliet walked straight to her writing table. Her cheeks were flushed, and
      her eyes were wet with tears. She drew out a sheet of note paper and wrote
      rapidly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear guardian,&mdash;I return you the check. I cannot accept such
      presents after all your goodness to me. I am sorry that you feel as you do
      about giving money away. You are so much older and wiser than I am that I
      dare not attempt to argue with you. Only it seems to me that life would be
      a cruelly selfish thing if we who are so much more fortunate than many of
      our fellow creatures did not sometimes try to help them a little through
      their misery. Perhaps I feel this a little more keenly because I wonder
      sometimes what might not have become of me but for your goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that you are going away without coming to see me again. You
      are not displeased with me, I hope, for asking you this, or for any other
      reason? I am foolish enough to feel a little lonely sometimes. Will you
      take me out again when you come back?&mdash;Your affectionate ward,
      Juliet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliet went out and posted her letter. On the way back she met Aynesworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit in the Park for a few minutes,&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and walked by his side willingly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been in to see me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have some tickets for the Haymarket for tonight. Do
      you think we could persuade Mrs. Tresfarwin to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we could,&rdquo; she answered, laughing. &ldquo;Hannah never wants any
      persuading. How nice of you to think of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that I think of you a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I think that that also is very nice of you!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like to be thought of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t? What is the play tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about it afterwards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is something else I
      want to say to you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. She scarcely showed so much interest as he would have liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about Berneval,&rdquo; he said, keeping his eyes fixed upon her face. &ldquo;I
      saw Mr. Pleydell today, and he told me that you were all going there. He
      suggested that I should come too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Can you really get off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sir Wingrave is going away, and doesn&rsquo;t want me. I must go
      somewhere, and I thought that I might go over and take rooms near you all.
      Would you care to have me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I would,&rdquo; she answered frankly. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly,
      her face clouding over&mdash;&ldquo;I forgot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going?&rdquo; he repeated incredulously. &ldquo;Mr. Pleydell told me that it was
      all arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;until today,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am a little uncertain now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I know why?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rather an inquisitive person,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;The fact is, I may
      need the money I have saved for Berneval for somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t go&mdash;I don&rsquo;t. But you can&rsquo;t
      stay in London all through the hot weather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Pengarth has asked me to go down there,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand suddenly upon hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliet,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lundy, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Lundy then! May I talk to you seriously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer you frivolous,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I like to be amused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be frivolous enough later on this evening. I&rsquo;ve been wondering if
      you&rsquo;d think it impertinent if I asked you to tell me about your guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just who he is, and why he is content to let you live with only an old
      woman to look after you. It isn&rsquo;t the best thing in the world for you, is
      it? I should like to know him, Juliet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I cannot tell you anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence. Aynesworth was disappointed, and showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly ordinary curiosity,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that!
      Only I feel that you need someone who has the right to advise you and look
      after you. I should like to be your guardian, Juliet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I like you so much better frivolous. Well, you
      shall have your wish. You shall be my guardian for the evening. I have one
      cutlet for dinner, and I am sure it will be spoilt. Will you come and
      share it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet and stood looking down upon him. He was struck, for
      the first time, by something different in her appearance. The smooth,
      delicate girlishness of her young face was, as yet, untroubled. Her eyes
      laughed frankly into his, and all the grace of natural childhood seemed
      still to linger about her. And yet&mdash;there was a change! Understanding
      was there; understanding, with sorrow in its wake. Aynesworth was suddenly
      anxious. Had anything happened of which he was ignorant? He rose up
      slowly. He was sure of himself now! Was he sure of her?

    <h2>
      A DEED OF GIFT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wingrave threw the paper aside with an impatient exclamation. A small
      notice in an obscure corner had attracted his attention; the young man,
      Richardson, had been fished out of the river half drowned, and in view of
      his tearful and abject penitence, had been allowed to go his way by a
      lenient magistrate. He had been ill, he pleaded, and disappointed. His
      former employer, in an Islington emporium, gave him a good character, and
      offered to take him back. So that was an end of Mr. Richardson, and the
      romance of his days!
    </p>
    <p>
      A worm like that to have brought him&mdash;the strong man, low! Wingrave
      thought with sullen anger as he leaned back in his chair with half-closed
      eyes. Here was an undignified hiatus, if not a finale, to all his schemes,
      to the even tenor of his self-restrained, purposeful life! The west wind
      was rippling through the orchards which bordered the garden. The muffled
      roar of the Atlantic was in his ears, a strange everlasting background to
      all the slighter summer sounds, the murmuring of insects, the calling of
      birds, the melodious swish of the whirling knives in the distant hayfield.
      Wingrave was alone with his thoughts, and he hated them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Pengarth was welcome, Mr. Pengarth very warm from his ride,
      carrying his hat and a small black bag in his hand. As he drew nearer, he
      became hotter and was obliged to rest his bag upon the path and mop his
      forehead. He was more afraid of his client than of anything else in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon, Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I trust that you are feeling
      better today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave eyed him coldly. He did not reply to the inquiry as to his
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have brought the deed?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Sir Wingrave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer produced a roll of parchment from his bag. In response to
      Wingrave&rsquo;s gesture, he seated himself on the extreme edge of an adjacent
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not propose to read all that stuff through,&rdquo; Wingrave remarked. &ldquo;I
      take it for granted that the deed is made out according to my
      instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Sir Wingrave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will go into the house, and I will sign it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth mopped his forehead once more. It was a terrible thing to
      have a conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I apologize most humbly for what I am about to
      say, but as the agent of your estates in this county and your&mdash;er&mdash;legal
      adviser with regard to them, I am forced to ask you whether you are quite
      determined upon this&mdash;most unexampled piece of generosity. Tredowen
      has been in your mother&rsquo;s family for a great many years, and although I
      must say that I have a great affection for this young lady, I have also an
      old fashioned dislike to seeing&mdash;er&mdash;family property pass into
      the hands of strangers. You might, forgive me&mdash;marry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave smiled very faintly, otherwise his face was inscrutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might,&rdquo; he admitted calmly, &ldquo;but I shall not. Do you consider me, Mr.
      Pengarth, to be a person in possession of his usual faculties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, most certainly&mdash;most certainly,&rdquo; the lawyer declared
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then please do not question my instructions any further. So far as
      regards the pecuniary part of it, I am a richer man than you have any idea
      of, Mr. Pengarth, and for the rest&mdash;sentiment unfortunately does not
      appeal to me. I choose to give the Tredowen estates away, to disappoint my
      next of kin. That is how you may regard the transaction. We will go into
      the house and complete this deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave rose slowly and walked with some difficulty up the gravel path.
      He ignored, however, his companion&rsquo;s timid offer of help, and led the way
      to the library. In a few minutes the document was signed and witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ordered tea in the garden,&rdquo; Wingrave said, as the two servants
      left the room; &ldquo;that is, unless you prefer any other sort of refreshment.
      I don&rsquo;t know much about the cellars, but there is some cabinet hock, I
      believe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I will not intrude upon you
      further. If you will allow me, I will ring the bell for my trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Wingrave answered testily. &ldquo;You will
      stay here and talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stay with pleasure if you desire it,&rdquo; the lawyer answered. &ldquo;I had
      an idea that you preferred solitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were wrong,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;I hate being alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved out together towards the garden. Tea was set out in a shady
      corner of the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will forgive my remarking it,&rdquo; Mr. Pengarth said, &ldquo;this seems
      rather an extraordinary place for you to come to if you really dislike
      solitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to escape from an intolerable situation, and because I was ill,&rdquo;
       Wingrave said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have brought friends,&rdquo; the lawyer suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no friends,&rdquo; Wingrave answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the people in the neighborhood would be very glad&mdash;&rdquo; Mr.
      Pengarth began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to see them,&rdquo; Wingrave answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth took a peach, and held his tongue. Wingrave broke the silence
      which followed a little abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Mr. Pengarth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do I look like a man likely to fail in
      anything he sets out to accomplish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer shook his head vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I feel like one,&rdquo; Wingrave said, &ldquo;and yet my record since I
      commenced, shall I call it my second life, is one of complete failure!
      Nothing that I planned have I been able to accomplish. I look back through
      the months and through the years, and I see not a single purpose carried
      out, not a single scheme successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so bad as that, I trust, Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; the lawyer protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the precise truth,&rdquo; Wingrave affirmed drily. &ldquo;I am losing
      confidence in myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; the lawyer declared, &ldquo;you have been the salvation of our dear
      Miss Juliet, if I may call her so. But for you, her life would have been
      ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Wingrave agreed. &ldquo;But I forgot! You don&rsquo;t understand! I have
      saved her from heaven knows what! I am going to give her the home she
      loves! Benevolence, isn&rsquo;t it? And yet, if I had only the pluck, I might
      succeed even now&mdash;so far as she is concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer took off his spectacles and rubbed them with his handkerchief.
      He was thoroughly bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might succeed,&rdquo; Wingrave repeated, leaning back in his chair, &ldquo;if only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face darkened. It seemed to Mr. Pengarth as he sipped his tea under
      the cool cedars, drawing in all their wonderful perfume with every puff of
      breeze, that he saw two men in the low invalid&rsquo;s chair before him. He saw
      the breath and desire of evil things struggling with some wonderful dream
      vainly seeking to realize itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of us,&rdquo; the lawyer said timidly, &ldquo;build our ideals too high up in
      the clouds, so that to reach them is very difficult. Nevertheless, the
      effort counts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave laughed mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not like that with me,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;My plans were made down in
      hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; the lawyer murmured. &ldquo;But you are not serious, Sir
      Wingrave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! I&rsquo;m serious enough,&rdquo; Wingrave answered. &ldquo;Do you suppose a man, with
      the best pages of his life rooted out, is likely to look out upon his
      fellows from the point of view of a philanthropist? Do you suppose that
      the man, into whose soul the irons of bitterness have gnawed and eaten
      their way, is likely to come out with a smirk and look around him for the
      opportunity of doing good? Rubbish! My aim is to encourage suffering
      wherever I see it, to create it where I can, to make sinners and thieves
      of honest people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; the lawyer gasped again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can be&mdash;as
      bad as you think you are. What about Juliet Lundy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fire flashed in Wingrave&rsquo;s eyes. Again, at the mention of her name, he
      seemed almost to lose control of himself. It was several moments before he
      spoke. He looked Mr. Pengarth in the face, and his tone was unusually
      deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gifts,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are not always given in friendship. Life may easily
      become a more complicated affair for that child with the Tredowen estates
      hanging round her neck. And anyhow, I disappoint my next of kin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morrison, smooth-footed and silent, appeared upon the lawn. He addressed
      Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady has arrived in a cab from Truro, sir,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;She wishes
      to see you as soon as convenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden light flashed across Wingrave&rsquo;s face, dying out again almost
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she, Morrison?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man glanced at Mr. Pengarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not give her name, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth and Wingrave both rose. The former at once made his adieux
      and took a short cut to the stables. Wingrave, who leaned heavily upon his
      stick, clutched Morrison by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it, Morrison?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Lady Ruth Barrington, sir,&rdquo; the man answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite alone, sir.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      FOR PITY&rsquo;S SAKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The library at Tredowen was a room of irregular shape, full of angles and
      recesses lined with bookcases. It was in one of these, standing motionless
      before a small marble statue of some forgotten Greek poet, that Wingrave
      found his visitor. She wore a plain serge traveling dress, and the pallor
      of her face, from which she had just lifted a voluminous veil, matched
      almost in color the gleaming white marble upon which she was gazing. But
      when she saw Wingrave, leaning upon his stick, and regarding her with
      stern surprise, strange lights seemed to flash in her eyes. There was no
      longer any resemblance between the pallor of her cheeks and the pallor of
      the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth,&rdquo; Wingrave said quietly, &ldquo;I do not understand what has procured
      for me the pleasure of this unexpected visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swayed a little towards him. Her head was thrown back, all the silent
      passion of the inexpressible, the hidden secondary forces of nature, was
      blazing out of her eyes, pleading with him in the broken music of her
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Ah, no! But can I make you
      understand? Will you listen to me for once as a human being? Will you
      remember that you are a man, and I a woman pleading for a little mercy&mdash;a
      little kindness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave moved a step further back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to offer you a chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank into it&mdash;speechless for a moment. Wingrave stood over her,
      leaning slightly against the corner of the bookcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will explain what all this means. If it is
      my help which you require&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands flashed out towards him&mdash;a gesture almost of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;you know that it is not that! You know very well
      that it is not. Why do you torture me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only ask you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She commenced talking quickly. Her sentences came in little gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted revenge&mdash;not in the ordinary way. You had brooded over it
      too long. You understood too well. Once it was I who sought to revenge
      myself on you because you would not listen to me! You hurt my pride.
      Everything that was evil in me rebelled&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this necessary?&rdquo; he interrupted coldly. &ldquo;I have never reproached you.
      You chose the path of safety for yourself. Many another woman in your
      place would doubtless have done the same thing! What I desire to know is
      why you are here in Cornwall. What has happened to make this journey seem
      necessary to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I want you to know how thoroughly you have
      succeeded. Before you came, Lumley and I were living together decently
      enough, and, as hundreds of others live, with outside interests for our
      chief distraction. You came, a friend! You were very subtle, very
      skillful! You never spoke a word of affection to me, but you managed
      things so that&mdash;people talked. You encouraged Lumley to speculate&mdash;not
      in actual words, perhaps, but by suggestion. Then you lent me money.
      Lumley, my husband, let me borrow from you. Everyone knew that we were
      ruined; everyone knew where the money came from that set us right. So
      misery has been piled upon misery. Lumley has lost his self respect, he is
      losing his ambition, he is deteriorating every day. I&mdash;how can I do
      anything else but despise him? He let me, his wife, come to your rooms to
      borrow money from you. Do you think I can ever forget that? Do you think
      that he can? Don&rsquo;t you know that the memory of it is dragging us apart,
      must keep us apart always&mdash;always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave leaned a little forward. His hands were clasped upon the handle
      of his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you tell me,&rdquo; he remarked coldly, &ldquo;might equally well have been
      said in London! I do not wish to seem inhospitable, but I am still waiting
      to know why you have taken an eight hours&rsquo; journey to recite a few fairly
      obvious truths. Your relations with your husband, frankly, do not interest
      me. The deductions which society may have drawn concerning our friendship
      need scarcely trouble you, under the circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then again the light was blazing in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the circumstances!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I know what you mean. It is true
      that you have asked for nothing. It is true that all this time you have
      never spoken a single word which all the world might not hear, you have
      never even touched my fingers, except as a matter of formality. Once I was
      the woman you loved&mdash;and I&mdash;well you know! Is this part of your
      scheme of torture, to play with me as though we were marionettes, you and
      I, with sawdust in our veins, dull, lifeless puppets! Well, it is finished&mdash;your
      vengeance! You may reap the harvest when you will! Publish my letters,
      prove yourself an injured man. Take a whip in your hand if you like, and I
      will never flinch. But, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, remember that I am a woman! I
      am willing to be your slave, nurse you, wait upon you, follow you about!
      What more can your vengeance need? You have made me despise my husband,
      you have made me hate my life with him! You have forced me into a
      remembrance of what I have never really forgotten&mdash;and oh! Wingrave,&rdquo;
       she added, opening her arms to him with a little sob, &ldquo;if you send me
      away, I think that I shall kill myself. Wingrave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of despair in her last cry. Her arms fell to her side.
      Wingrave was on his way to the further end of the room. He rang the bell
      and turned towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;you will return to London tonight. If ever I
      require you, I shall send for you&mdash;and you will come. At present I do
      not. You will return to your husband. Understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. Morrison was at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morrison,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will order the motor to be round in half an hour
      to take Lady Ruth to Truro, She has to catch the London express. You will
      go with her yourself, and see that she has a reserved carriage. If, by any
      chance, you should miss the train, order a special.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell the cook to send in tea and wine, and some sandwiches, in ten
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more they were alone. Lady Ruth rose slowly to her feet and,
      trembling in every limb, she walked down the room and fell on her knees
      before Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will go away. I will do all that you tell me; I
      will wear my chains bravely, and hold my peace. But before I go, for
      heaven&rsquo;s sake, say a kind word, look at me kindly, kiss me, hold my hands;
      anything, anything, anything to prove to me that you are not a dead man. I
      could bear unkindness, reproaches, abuse. I can bear anything but this
      deadly coldness. It is becoming a horror to me! Do, Wingrave&mdash;do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped his hand&mdash;he drew it calmly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ruth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have spoken the truth. I am a dead man. I have
      no affections; I care neither for you nor for any living being. All that
      goes to the glory and joy of life perished in that uncountable roll of
      days, when the sun went out, and inch by inch the wall rose which will
      divide me forever from you and all the world. Frankly, it was not I who
      once loved you. It was the man who died in prison. His flesh and bones may
      have survived&mdash;nothing else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose slowly to her feet. Her eyes seemed to be dilating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another woman!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly. Her voice was like velvet,
      but the agony in her face was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no other woman,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood quite still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is here with you now,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Who is it, Wingrave? Tell me the
      truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is already told,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Except my cook and her
      assistants, there is not a woman in the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she listened. She gave a little hoarse cry, and Wingrave started.
      Out in the hall a girl&rsquo;s clear laugh rang like a note of music to their
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; she cried fiercely. &ldquo;You lie! I will know who she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door was thrown open! Juliet stood there, her hands full of
      roses, her face flushed and brilliant with smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful to find you here!&rdquo; she exclaimed, coming swiftly across to
      Wingrave. &ldquo;I do hope you won&rsquo;t mind my coming. Normandy is off, and I have
      nowhere else to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw Lady Ruth and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I beg your pardon!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I did not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Lady Ruth Barrington,&rdquo; Wingrave said; &ldquo;my ward, Miss Juliet
      Lundy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your&mdash;ward?&rdquo; Lady Ruth said, gazing at her intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliet nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave has been very kind to me since I was a child,&rdquo; she said
      softly. &ldquo;He has let me live here with Mrs. Tresfarwin, and I am afraid I
      sometimes forget that it is not really my home. Am I in the way?&rdquo; she
      asked, looking wistfully towards Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Lady Ruth is just going. Will you see that
      she has some tea or something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth laughed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that it is I who am in the way! I should love some
      tea, if there is time, but whatever happens, I must not miss that train.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A DREAM OF PARADISE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It seemed to Wingrave that the days which followed formed a sort of hiatus
      in his life&mdash;an interlude during which some other man in his place,
      and in his image, played the game of life to a long-forgotten tune. He
      moved through the hours as a man in a maze, unrecognizable to himself,
      half unconscious, half heedless of the fact that the garments of his
      carefully cultivated antagonism to the world and to his fellows had
      slipped very easily from his unresisting shoulders. The glory of a perfect
      English midsummer lay like a golden spell upon the land. The moors were
      purple with heather, touched here and there with the fire of the flaming
      gorse, the wind blew always from the west, the gardens were ablaze with
      slowly bursting rhododendrons. Every gleam of coloring, every breath of
      perfume, seemed to carry him unresistingly back to the days of his
      boyhood. He fished once more in the trout streams; he threw away his
      stick, and tramped or rode with Juliet across the moors. At night time she
      sang or played with the windows open, Wingrave himself out of sight under
      the cedar trees, whose perfume filled with aromatic sweetness the still
      night air. Piles of letters came every day, which he left unopened upon
      his study table. Telegrams followed, which he threw into the wastepaper
      basket. Juliet watched the accumulating heap with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever do people write to you so much for?&rdquo; she asked one morning,
      watching the stream of letters flow out of the post bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave was silent for a moment. Her question brought a sudden and sharp
      sting of remembrance. Juliet knew him only as Sir Wingrave Seton. She knew
      nothing of Mr. Wingrave, millionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advertisements, a good many of them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must send for
      Aynesworth some day to go through them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Do send for him! He thinks that I am staying
      with Miss Pengarth, and I haven&rsquo;t written once since I got here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Wingrave, it seemed that a chill had somehow stolen into the hot summer
      morning. His feet were very nearly upon the earth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Aynesworth was&mdash;a friend of yours. He came
      and saw you often in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been very, very kind,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He was always that, from the
      first time I saw you both. Do you remember? It was down in the lower
      gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I remember quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very kind to me then,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and you&mdash;well, I was
      frightened of you.&rdquo; She stopped for a moment and laughed. Her eyes were
      full of amazed reminiscence. &ldquo;You were so cold and severe! I never could
      have dreamed that, after all, it was you who were going to be the dearest,
      most generous friend I could ever have had! Do you know, Walter&mdash;I
      mean Mr. Aynesworth&mdash;isn&rsquo;t very pleased with me just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot understand why I will not tell him my guardian&rsquo;s name. I think
      it worries him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would like to tell him?&rdquo; Wingrave asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave said no more, but after breakfast he went to his study alone.
      Juliet found him there an hour later, sitting idly in front of his table.
      His great pile of correspondence was still untouched. She came and sat on
      the edge of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do this morning, please?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave glanced towards his letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I must spend the day here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not really!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought that we were going to walk to
      Hanging Tor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave took up a handful of letters and let them fall through his
      fingers. He had all the sensations of a man who is awakened from a dream
      of Paradise to face the dull tortures of a dreary and eventless life. His
      eyes were set in a fixed state. An undernote of despair was in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we arranged it yesterday,&rdquo; she continued eagerly, &ldquo;and if you
      are going to send for Mr. Aynesworth, you needn&rsquo;t bother about these
      letters yourself, need you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and regarded her deliberately. Her forehead was wrinkled a
      little with disappointment, her brown eyes were filled with the soft light
      of confident appeal. Tall and elegantly slim, there was yet something in
      the graceful lines of her figure which reminded him forcibly that the days
      of her womanhood had indeed arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a plain white cambric dress and a simple, but much beflowered
      hat; the smaller details of her toilet all indicated the correct taste and
      instinctive coquetry of her French descent. And she was beautiful!
      Wingrave regarded her critically and realized, perhaps for the first time,
      how beautiful. Her eyes were large and clear, and her eyebrows delicately
      defined. Her mouth, with its slightly humorous curl, was a little large,
      but wholly delightful. The sun of the last few weeks had given to her skin
      a faint, but most becoming, duskiness. Under his close scrutiny, a flush
      of color stole into her cheeks. She laughed not altogether naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look at me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as though I were someone strange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;for the child, the little black-frocked
      child, you know, with the hair down her back, and the tearful eyes. I
      don&rsquo;t think I realized that she had vanished so completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more completely,&rdquo; she declared gaily, &ldquo;than the gloomy gentleman who
      frowned upon my existence and resented even my gratitude. Although,&rdquo; she
      added, leaning a little towards him, &ldquo;I am very much afraid that I see
      some signs of a relapse today. Don&rsquo;t bother about those horrid letters.
      Let me tell Mrs. Tresfarwin to pack us up some lunch, and take me to
      Hanging Tor, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave laughed a little unsteadily as he rose to his feet. One day more,
      then! Why not? The end would be soon enough!...
    </p>
    <p>
      Sooner, perhaps, than even he imagined, for that night Aynesworth came,
      pale and travel-stained, with all the volcanic evidences of a great
      passion blazing in his eyes, quivering in his tone. The day had passed to
      Wingrave as a dream, more beautiful even than any in the roll of its
      predecessors. They sat together on low chairs upon the moonlit lawn, in
      their ears the murmur of the sea; upon their faces, gathering strength
      with the darkness, the night wind, salt and fragrant with all the
      sweetness of dying flowers. Wingrave had never realized more completely
      what still seemed to him this wonderful gap in his life. Behind it all, he
      had a subconsciousness that he was but taking a part in some mystical
      play; yet with an abandon which, when he stopped to think of it,
      astonished him, he gave himself up without effort or scruple to this most
      amazing interlude. All day he had talked more than ever before; the flush
      on his cheeks was like the flush of wine or the sun which had fired his
      blood. As he had talked the more, so had she grown the more silent. She
      was sitting now with her hands clasped and her head thrown back, looking
      up at the stars with unseeing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not regret Normandy, then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I have been happy here. I have been happier than I
      could ever have been in Normandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked at her with curious intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My experience,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;of young ladies of your age is
      somewhat limited. But I should have thought that you would have found it&mdash;lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am different, then,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I have never been lonely
      here&mdash;all my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except,&rdquo; he reminded her, &ldquo;when I knew you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! But that was different,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I had no home in those days,
      and I was afraid of being sent away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in his mind then to tell her of the envelope with her name upon it
      in his study, but a sudden rush of confusing thoughts kept him silent. It
      was while he was laboring in the web of this tangled dream of wild but
      beautiful emotions that Aynesworth came. A pale, tragic figure in his
      travel-stained clothes, and face furrowed with anxiety, he stood over them
      almost before they were aware of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter!&rdquo; she cried, and sprang to her feet with extended hands.
      Wingrave&rsquo;s face darkened, and the shadow of evil crept into his suddenly
      altered expression. It was an abrupt awakening this, and he hated the man
      who had brought it about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth held the girl&rsquo;s hands for a moment, but his manner was
      sufficient evidence of the spirit in which he had come. He drew a little
      breath, and he looked from one to the other anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this&mdash;your mysterious guardian, Juliet?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at Wingrave questioningly. His expression was ominous, and the
      light faded from her own face. While she hesitated, Wingrave spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the fact is fairly obvious. What have you to
      say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good deal,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered passionately. &ldquo;Juliet, please go away.
      I must speak to your guardian&mdash;alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she looked at Wingrave. He pointed to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you had better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. Something of the impending storm was already manifest.
      Aynesworth turned suddenly towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not enter that house again, Juliet,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Stay in the
      gardens there, and presently you shall know why.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE AWAKENING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wingrave had risen to his feet. He was perfectly calm, but there was a
      look on his face which Juliet had never seen there before. Instinctively
      she drew a little away, and Aynesworth took his place between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, Aynesworth?&rdquo; Wingrave asked coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I have been mad to stay with you for four
      years, to look on, however passively, at all the evil you have done. I&rsquo;ve
      had enough of it now, and of you! I came here to tell you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter,&rdquo; Wingrave answered, &ldquo;would have been equally efficacious.
      However, since you have told me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go when I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve more to say. When
      I first entered your service and you told me what your outlook upon life
      was, I never dreamed but that the years would make a man of you again, I
      never believed that you could be such a brute as to carry out your
      threats. I saw you do your best to corrupt a poor, silly little woman, who
      only escaped ruin by a miracle; I saw you deal out what might have been
      irretrievable disaster to a young man just starting in life. Since your
      return to London, you have done as little good, and as much harm, with
      your millions as any man could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave was beginning to look bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is getting,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;a little like melodrama. I have no
      objection to being abused, even in my own garden, but there are limits to
      my patience. Come to the point, if you have one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I want you to understand this. I have
      never tried to interfere in any of your malicious schemes, although I am
      ashamed to think I have watched them without protest. But this one is
      different. If you have harmed, if you should ever dare to harm this child,
      as sure as there is a God above us, I will kill you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she to you?&rdquo; Wingrave asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;I love her,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I mean her to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks upon me as her greatest friend, her natural protector, and
      protect her I will&mdash;even against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the young lady is very well off as she
      is. She has lived in my house, and been taken care of by my servants. She
      has been relieved of all the material cares of life, and she has been her
      own mistress. I scarcely see how you, my young friend, could do better for
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth moved a step nearer to him. The veins on his forehead were
      swollen. His voice was hoarse with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you done this for her?&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;secretly, too, you a man
      to whom a good action is a matter for a sneer, who have deliberately
      proclaimed yourself an evil-doer by choice and destiny? Why have you
      constituted yourself her guardian? Not from kindness for you don&rsquo;t know
      what it is; not from good nature for you haven&rsquo;t any. Why, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit,&rdquo; he remarked coolly, &ldquo;that it does seem rather a problem; we all
      do unaccountable things at times, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your own sake,&rdquo; Aynesworth said fiercely, &ldquo;I trust that this is one
      of the unaccountable things. For the rest, you shall have no other chance.
      I shall take her to Truro tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that she will go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell her the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if she does not believe you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will! If you interfere, I shall take her by force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I interfere!&rdquo; Wingrave remarked. &ldquo;You need not be afraid of that. The
      affair as it stands is far too interesting. Call her, and make your
      appeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell her the truth,&rdquo; Aynesworth declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means! I shall remain and listen to my indictment. Quite a novel
      sensation! Call the young lady, by all means, and don&rsquo;t spare me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth moved a few steps up the path. He called to her softly, and she
      came through the little iron gates from the rose gardens. She was very
      pale, and there was a gleam in her eyes which was like fear. Aynesworth
      took her by the hand and led her forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be brave, dear,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I am compelled to say some
      disagreeable things. It is for your good. It is because I care for you so
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked towards Wingrave. He was sitting upon the garden seat, and his
      face was absolutely expressionless. He spoke to her, and his cold, precise
      tone betrayed not the slightest sign of any emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aynesworth,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;is going to tell you some interesting facts
      about myself. Please listen attentively as afterwards you will be called
      upon to make a somewhat important decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a little wistfully and sighed. There was no trace any
      longer of her companion of the last few weeks. It was the stern and gloomy
      stranger of her earlier recollections who sat there with folded arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really necessary?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered hurriedly. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long, but
      there are things which you must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth inclined his head towards the place where Wingrave sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will admit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the man there, whom I have served for the
      last four years and more, never deceived me as to his real character and
      intentions. He had been badly treated by a woman, and he told me plainly
      that he entered into life again at war with his fellows. Where he could
      see an opportunity of doing evil, he meant to do it; where he could bring
      misery and suffering upon anyone with whom he came into contact, he meant
      to grasp the opportunity. I listened to him, but I never believed. I told
      myself that it would be interesting to watch his life, and to see the
      gradual, inevitable humanizing of the man. So I entered his service, and
      have remained in it until today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned more directly towards Juliet. She was listening breathlessly to
      every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he has kept his word. I have been by his side, and I
      speak of the things I know. He has sought no one&rsquo;s friendship who has not
      suffered for it, there is not a man or woman living who owes him the
      acknowledgment of a single act of kindness. I have seen him deliberately
      scheme to bring about the ruin of a harmless little woman. I have seen him
      exact his pound of flesh, even at the cost of ruin, from a boy. I tell
      you, Juliet, of my own knowledge, that he has neither heart nor
      conscience, and that he glories in the evil that his hand finds to do.
      Even you must know something of his reputation&mdash;have heard something
      of his doings, under the name he is best known by in London&mdash;Mr.
      Wingrave, millionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started back as though in terror. Then she turned to Wingrave, who sat
      stonily silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You are not&mdash;that man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes and looked at her. It seemed to her that there was
      something almost satanic in the smile which alone disturbed the serenity
      of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I am,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;when I returned from America, it suited me
      to change my identity. You must not doubt anything that Mr. Aynesworth
      says. I can assure you that he is a most truthful and conscientious young
      man. I shall be able to give him a testimonial with a perfectly clear
      conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliet shuddered as she turned away. All the joy of life seemed to have
      gone from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Mr. Wingrave&mdash;the Mr. Wingrave. Oh! I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she
      broke off suddenly. &ldquo;No one could have been so kind, so generous, as you
      have been to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked from one to the other of the two men. Both were silent, but
      whereas Aynesworth had turned his head away, Wingrave&rsquo;s position and
      attitude were unchanged. She moved suddenly over towards him. One hand
      fell almost caressingly upon his shoulder. She looked eagerly into his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;that it isn&rsquo;t all true,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Tell me that your
      kindness to me, at least, was real&mdash;that you did not mean it to be
      for my unhappiness afterwards. Please tell me that. I think if you asked
      me, if you cared to ask me, that I could forgive everything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every vice, save one,&rdquo; Wingrave murmured, &ldquo;Nature has lavished upon me. I
      am a poor liar. It is perfectly true that my object in life has been
      exactly as Aynesworth has stated it. I may have been more or less
      successful&mdash;Aynesworth can tell you that, too. As regards yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you upon your escape,&rdquo; Wingrave said. &ldquo;Aynesworth is
      right. Association of any sort with me is for your evil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She covered her face with her hands. Even his tone was different. She felt
      that this man was a stranger, and a stranger to be feared. Aynesworth came
      over to her side and drew her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a cart outside,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going to take you to Truro&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave heard the gate close after them&mdash;he heard the rumble of the
      cart in the road growing fainter and fainter. He was alone now in the
      garden, and the darkness was closing around him. He staggered to his feet.
      His face was back in its old set lines. He was once more at war with the
      world.

    <h2>
      REVENGE IS&mdash;BITTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      At no time during his career did Wingrave appear before the public more
      prominently than during the next few months. As London began to fill up
      again, during the early part of October, he gave many and magnificent
      entertainments, his name figured in all the great social events, he bought
      a mansion in Park Lane which had been built for Royalty, and the account
      of the treasures with which he filled it read like a chapter from some
      modern Arabian Nights. In the city, he was more hated and dreaded than
      ever. His transactions, huge and carefully thought out, were for his own
      aggrandizement only, and left always in their wake ruin and disaster for
      the less fortunate and weaker speculators. He played for his own hand
      only, the camaraderie of finance he ignored altogether. In one other
      respect, too, he occupied a unique position amongst the financial magnates
      of the moment. All appeals on behalf of charity he steadily ignored. He
      gave nothing away. His name never figured amongst the hospital lists;
      suffering and disaster, which drew their humble contributions from the
      struggling poor and middle classes, left him unmoved and his check book
      unopened. In an age when huge gifts on behalf of charity was the
      fashionable road to the peerage, his attitude was all the more noticeable.
      He would give a thousand pounds for a piece of Sevres china which took his
      fancy; he would not give a thousand farthings to ease the sufferings of
      his fellows. Yet there were few found to criticize him. He was called
      original, a crank; there were even some who professed to see merit in his
      attitude. To both criticism and praise he was alike indifferent. With a
      cynicism with seemed only to become more bitter he pursued his undeviating
      and deliberate way.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning he met Lady Ruth on the pavement in Bond Street. She pointed
      to the vacant seat in her landau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in, please, for a few minutes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to talk to you. I
      will take you where you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove off in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not at the Wavertons&rsquo; last night,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she answered quietly. &ldquo;I was not asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you were so friendly,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Lady Waverton scarcely knows me now! It is the
      beginning of the end, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a little enigmatical this morning,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! You understand me very well,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Everybody knows that
      it is you who keep us going. Lumley has not got quite used to taking your
      money. He has lost nearly all his ambition. Soon his day will have gone
      by. People shrug their shoulders when they speak of us. Two years ago the
      Wavertons were delighted to know me. Society seems big, but it isn&rsquo;t.
      There are no end of little sets, one inside the other. Two years ago, I
      was in the innermost, today I&rsquo;m getting towards the outside edge. Look at
      me! Do you see any change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scrutinized her mercilessly in the cold morning light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look older,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you have begun to use rouge, which is a
      pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed hardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so? Well, I don&rsquo;t want Emily to see my hollow cheeks&mdash;or
      you! Are you satisfied, Wingrave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; she interrupted curtly. &ldquo;You do understand. This is your
      vengeance&mdash;very subtle and very crafty. Everything has turned out
      exactly as you planned. You have broken us, Wingrave! I thought myself a
      clever woman, but I might as well have tried to gamble with the angels.
      Why don&rsquo;t you finish it off now&mdash;make me run away with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would bore us both,&rdquo; he answered calmly. &ldquo;Besides, you wouldn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should, and you know that I would,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Everyone expects it
      of us. I think myself that it would be more decent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a strange woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I find it hard sometimes to
      understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are a fool,&rdquo; she declared in a fierce little whisper. &ldquo;You know
      what is underneath all my suffering, all my broken pride! You know that I
      was fool enough to keep the flame flickering&mdash;that I have cared
      always and for no one else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the most original woman I ever met,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I neither
      wish to care nor be cared for by anyone. Go home to your husband, and tell
      him to buy Treadwells up to six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That same afternoon Wingrave met Aynesworth and cut him dead. Something in
      the younger man&rsquo;s appearance, though, perplexed him. Aynesworth certainly
      had not the air of a successful man. He was pale, carelessly dressed, and
      apparently in ill health. Wingrave, after an amount of hesitation, which
      was rare with him, turned his car towards Battersea, and found himself, a
      few minutes later, mounting the five flights of stone steps. Juliet
      herself opened the door to him. She gave a little gasp when she saw who it
      was, and did not immediately invite him to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Wingrave said coldly, &ldquo;to inflict this visit upon you. If
      you are alone, and afraid to ask me in, we can talk here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks became as flushed as a moment before they had been pale. She
      looked at him reproachfully, and, standing on one side to let him pass,
      closed the door behind him. Then she led the way into her sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad that you have come to see me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ignored her invitation, and stood looking around him. There was a
      noticeable change in the little room. There were no flowers, some of the
      ornaments and the silver trifles from her table were missing. The place
      seemed to have been swept bare of everything, except the necessary
      furniture. Then he looked at her. She was perceptibly thinner, and there
      were black rings under her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Tresfarwin?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Cornwall,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not afford to keep her here any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing for a living&mdash;painting still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head a little piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t sell any more of my pictures,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am trying to get a
      situation as governess or companion or&mdash;anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you have anything to eat last?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; she answered, and he was just in time to catch her. She had
      fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid her upon the sofa, poured some water over her face, and fanned her
      with a newspaper. His expression of cold indifference remained unmoved. It
      was there in his face when she opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you well enough to walk?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, thank you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am so sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on your hat,&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared for a few minutes, and returned dressed for the street. He
      drove her to a restaurant and ordered some dinner. He made her drink some
      wine, and while they waited he buried himself in a newspaper. They ate
      their meal almost in silence. Afterwards, Wingrave asked her a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Aynesworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for work, I think,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not stay down in Cornwall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Pengarth was away&mdash;and I preferred to return to London,&rdquo; she
      told him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going to marry Aynesworth?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down into her glass and was silent. He leaned a little towards
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he remarked quietly, &ldquo;you are already married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she was silent. He saw the tears forced back from her eyes. He heard
      the sob break in her throat. Yet he said nothing. He only waited. At last
      she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is settled yet,&rdquo; she said, still without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no reason,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;why, until that time, you should
      refuse to accept your allowance from Mr. Pengarth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot take any more of your money,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It was a mistake
      from the first, but I was foolish. I did not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lip curled with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are one of those,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who, as a child, were wise, but as a
      young woman with a little knowledge, become&mdash;a prig. What harm is my
      money likely to do you? I may be the Devil himself, but my gold is not
      tainted. For the rest, granted that I am at war with the world, I do not
      number children amongst my enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes then, and looked him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not afraid of you,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It is not that; but I have been
      dependent long enough. I will keep myself&mdash;or starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and paid the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will take you wherever you like. I have a call to make
      close here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood upon the pavement. She held out her hand a little timidly. Her
      eyes were soft and wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye, guardian,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thank you very much for my lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;if you would let me always call myself that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got into the car without a word. Wingrave walked straight back to his
      own house. Several people were waiting in the entrance hall, and the
      visitors&rsquo; book was open upon the porter&rsquo;s desk. He walked through, looking
      neither to the right nor the left, crossed the great library, with its
      curved roof, its floor of cedar wood, and its wonderful stained-glass
      windows, and entered a smaller room beyond&mdash;his absolute and
      impenetrable sanctum. He rang the bell for his servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morrison,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you allow me to be disturbed by any living
      person, on any pretense whatever, until I ring, you lose your place. Do
      you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave locked the door. The next hour belonged to himself alone...
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he rang the bell, he gave Morrison a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is to be delivered at once,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed and withdrew. Wingrave, with his hands behind him, strolled
      out into the library. In a remote corner, a small spectacled person was
      busy writing at a table. Wingrave crossed the room and stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you my librarian?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man rose at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;My name is Woodall. You may have forgotten
      it. I am at work now upon a new catalogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a quarto Shakespeare, I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I marked at
      Sotheby&rsquo;s, also a manuscript Thomas a Kempis, and a first edition of
      Herrick. I should like to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; the man answered, hurrying to the shelves. &ldquo;You have,
      also, a wonderful rare collection of manuscripts, purchased from the Abbey
      St. Jouvain, and a unique Horace. If you will permit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave spent half an hour examining his treasures, leaving his attendant
      astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A millionaire who understands!&rdquo; he exclaimed softly as he resumed his
      seat. &ldquo;Miraculous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave passed into the hall, and summoned his major domo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me the ballroom,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and the winter garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man in quiet black clothes&mdash;Wingrave abhorred liveries&mdash;led
      him respectfully through rooms probably unequaled for magnificence in
      England. He spoke of the exquisite work of French and Italian artists;
      with a gesture almost of reverence he pointed out the carving in the
      wonderful white ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave listened and watched with immovable face. Just as they had
      completed their tour, Morrison approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lumley and Lady Ruth Barrington are in the library, sir,&rdquo; he
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming at once,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      THE WAY OF PEACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      They awaited his coming in varying moods. Barrington was irritable and
      restless, Lady Ruth gave no signs of any emotion whatever. She had the air
      of a woman who had no longer fear or hope. Only her eyes were a little
      weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrington was walking up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, his
      eyes fixed upon his wife. Every now and then he glanced nervously towards
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if he wants a settlement&mdash;well, there&rsquo;s an end
      of all things. And I don&rsquo;t see why he shouldn&rsquo;t. He hasn&rsquo;t lent money out
      of friendship. He hates me&mdash;always has done, and sometimes I wonder
      whether he doesn&rsquo;t hate you too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth shivered a little. Her husband&rsquo;s words came to her with peculiar
      brutality. It was as though he were blaming her for not having proved more
      attractive to the man who held them in the hollow of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;that a discussion like this is
      scarcely in the best possible taste? We cannot surmise what he wants&mdash;what
      he is going to do. Let us wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Wingrave entered. To Barrington, who greeted him with
      nervous cordiality, he presented the same cold, impenetrable appearance;
      Lady Ruth, with quicker perceptions, noticed at once the change. She sat
      up in her chair eagerly. It was what she had prayed for, this&mdash;but
      was it for good or evil? Her eyes sought his eagerly. So much depended
      upon his first few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave closed the door behind him. His greetings were laconic as usual.
      He addressed Lady Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find myself obliged,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to take a journey which may possibly be
      a somewhat protracted one. I wished, before I left, to see you and your
      husband. I sent for you together, but I wish to speak to you separately&mdash;to
      your husband first. You have often expressed a desire to see over my
      house, Lady Ruth. My major domo is outside. Will you forgive me if I send
      you away for a few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruth rose slowly to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you wish me to keep away?&rdquo; she asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few minutes only,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You will find me here when Parkinson
      has shown you round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held the door open and she passed out, with a single upward and
      wondering glance. Wingrave closed the door, and seated himself close to
      where Barrington was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barrington,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;twenty years ago we were friends. Since then we
      have been enemies. Today, so far as I am concerned, we are neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington started a little. His lips twitched nervously. He did not quite
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, Wingrave&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave interrupted him ruthlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you credit,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for understanding that my attitude
      towards you since I&mdash;er&mdash;reappeared, has been inimical. I
      intended you to speculate, and you did speculate. I meant you to lose, and
      you have lost. The money I lent to your wife was meant to remain a rope
      around your neck. The fact that I lent it to her was intended to humiliate
      you, the attentions which I purposely paid to her in public were intended
      to convey a false impression to society&mdash;and in this, too, I fancy
      that I have been successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington drew a thick breath&mdash;the dull color was mounting to his
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave continued calmly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had possibly in my mind, at one time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the idea of drawing
      things on to a climax&mdash;of witnessing the final disappearance of
      yourself and your wife from the world&mdash;such as we know it. I have,
      however, ceased to derive amusement or satisfaction from pursuing what we
      may call my vengeance. Consequently, it is finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light of hope leaped into Barrington&rsquo;s dull eyes, but he recognized
      Wingrave&rsquo;s desire for silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few feet to your left, upon my writing table,&rdquo; Wingrave continued, &ldquo;you
      will find an envelope addressed to yourself. It contains a discharge, in
      full, for the money I have lent you. I have also ventured to place to your
      credit, at your own bank, a sum sufficient to give you a fresh start. When
      you return to Cadogan Square, or, at least, this evening, you will receive
      a communication from the Prime Minister, inviting you to become one of the
      International Board of Arbitration on the Alaskan question. The position,
      as you know, is a distinguished one, and if you should be successful, your
      future career should be assured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington broke down. He covered his face with his hands. Great sobs
      shook him. Wingrave waited for a few minutes, and then rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barrington,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is one thing more! What the world may say or
      think counts for very little. Society reverses its own judgments and eats
      its own words every day. A little success will bring it to your feet like
      a whipped dog. It is for yourself I say this, for yourself alone. There is
      no reason why you should hesitate to accept any service I may be able to
      render you. You understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barrington&rsquo;s face was like the face of a young man. All the cloud of
      suspicion and doubts and fears was suddenly lifted. He looked through new
      eyes on to a new world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Not that I ever doubted it, Wingrave, but&mdash;thank
      God!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrington left the house radiant,&mdash;Lady Ruth and Wingrave were
      alone. She watched him close the door and turn towards her, with a new
      timidity. The color came and went in her pale cheeks, her eyes were no
      longer tired. When he turned towards her, she leaned to him with a little
      seductive movement of her body. Her hands stole out towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first action seemed to crush all the desperate joy which was rising
      fast in her heart. He took one hand, and he led her to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been talking to your husband. There are only a
      few words I want to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are only three I want to hear from you,&rdquo; she murmured, and her eyes
      were pleading with him passionately all the time. &ldquo;It seems to me that I
      have been waiting to hear them all my life. Wingrave, I am so tired&mdash;and
      I am losing&mdash;I want to leave it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he answered cheerfully, &ldquo;what you are going to do. You are
      going to America with your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rather tired of the game,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is all. I am like the
      child who likes to build up again the house of bricks which he has thrown
      down. I have procured for your husband a seat on the Alaskan Board. It is
      a very distinguished position, and you will find that it will entail
      considerable social obligations in America. When you return, he will be
      able to claim a judgeship, or a place in the Government. You will find
      things go smoothly enough then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I want you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lady Ruth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you may think so at this moment, but you are
      very much mistaken. What you really desire is a complete reconciliation
      with your husband and a place in the great world which no one shall be
      able to question. These things are arranged for you; also&mdash;these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed her a little packet. She dropped it idly into her lap. She was
      looking steadfastly away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are free from me now,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You will find life run quite
      smoothly, and I do not think that you will be troubled with me when you
      come back from America. I have other plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a slave,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;who grew to love her gaoler, and when
      they came to set her free and take her back to her own people&mdash;she
      prayed only to be left in her cell! Freedom for her meant a broken heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was fiction,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;For you, freedom will mean other
      things. There is work for you to do, honorable work. You must fan the
      flame of your husband&rsquo;s ambition, you must see that he does justice to his
      great opportunities. You have your own battle to fight with society, but
      you have the winning cards for, before you go, you and your husband will
      be received as guests&mdash;well, by the one person whose decision is
      absolute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word of honor,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;was enough for Lord Marendon. You
      will find things go smoothly with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wonderful,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;but&mdash;you&mdash;you spoke of going
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to travel,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;rather a long journey. I have
      lived three lives, I am going to try a fourth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite alone,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me where you are going?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot do that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It is my secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet. She was very pale. She stood in front of him, and
      she laid her hands upon his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will obey. I will live the life you have shown
      me, and I will live it successfully. But I will know this. Who is it that
      has succeeded where I have failed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do!&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;and I will know. For years you have been a man
      with a shell upon your heart. Every good impulse, every kind thought
      seemed withered up. You were absolutely cold, absolutely passionless! I
      have worn myself out trying to call you back to your own, to set the blood
      flowing once more in your veins, to break for one moment the barriers
      which you had set up against Nature herself. Some day, I felt that it must
      come&mdash;and it has! Who has done it, Wingrave? It is not&mdash;Emily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I have not seen her for months. She has no
      interest for me&mdash;she never had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me who it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature unaided,&rdquo; he answered carelessly. &ldquo;Human intervention was not
      necessary. It was the swing of the pendulum, Ruth, the eternal law which
      mocks our craving for content. I had no sooner succeeded in my new
      capacity&mdash;than the old man crept out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Nature has her weapons always,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Wingrave, was it the
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched the electric bell. Taking her hands, he bent down and kissed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;goodbye&mdash;good fortune! Conquer new worlds, and
      remember&mdash;white is your color, and Paquin your one modiste. Morrison,
      Lady Barrington&rsquo;s carriage.&rdquo;

     </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth was loth to depart. He felt that all pretext for lingering
      was gone, that he had outstayed his welcome. Yet he found himself
      desperately striving for some excuse to prolong an interview which was to
      all effects and purposes concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best, Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, reverting to the subject of
      their interview, &ldquo;to study Miss Lundy&rsquo;s interests in every way. I will
      also see that she has the letter you have left for her within eight days
      from now. But if you could see you way to leave some sort of address so
      that I should have a chance of communicating with you, if necessary, I
      should assume my responsibilities with a lighter heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave gave vent to a little gesture of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;surely I have been explicit enough. I have told
      you that, within a week from now, I shall be practically dead. I shall
      never return to England&mdash;you will never see me again. I have given
      life here a fair trial, and found it a failure. I am going to make a new
      experiment&mdash;and it is going to be in an unexplored country. You could
      not reach me there through the post. You, I think, would scarcely care to
      follow me. Let it go at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth took up his bag with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a simple man, and life with me has always
      been a very simple affair. I recognize the fact, of course, that I am not
      in a position to judge or to understand the mental attitude of one who,
      like yourself, has suffered and passed through great crises. But I cannot
      help wishing that you could find it possible to try, for a time, the quiet
      life of a countryman in this beautiful home of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pengarth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no two men are born alike into this world. Some
      are blessed with a contented mind, some are wanderers by destiny. You will
      forgive me if I do not discuss the matter with you more fully. My journey,
      wherever and whatever it is, is inevitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pengarth was braver than he had ever been in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is one journey which we must all take in
      God&rsquo;s good time. But the man who starts before he is called finds no
      welcome at the end. The greatest in life are those who are content to
      wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the least disposed to doubt it, Mr. Pengarth,&rdquo; Wingrave said
      calmly. &ldquo;Now I must really send you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Pengarth went, but Wingrave was not long destined to remain in
      solitude. There was a sound of voices in the hall, Morrison&rsquo;s protesting,
      another insistent. Then the door opened, and Wingrave looked up with
      darkening face, which did not lighten when he recognized the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aynesworth!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what are you doing here? What do you want
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered, &ldquo;and I mean to have it. You may as
      well tell your man to take his hand off my shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave nodded to Morrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come back when I ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were alone! Aynesworth threw down his hat and crossed the room until
      he was within a few feet of Wingrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth laughed a little unnaturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is humiliating, but the discipline is good
      for me! I was determined to come and see once more the man who has made an
      utter and complete fool of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave eyed him coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would be good enough to explain,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll explain,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;I engaged myself to you as
      secretary, didn&rsquo;t I, and I told you the reason at the time? I wanted to
      make a study of you. I wanted to trace the effect of your long period of
      isolation upon your subsequent actions. I entered upon my duties&mdash;how
      you must have smiled at me behind my back! Never was a man more completely
      and absolutely deceived. I lived with you, was always by your side, I was
      there professedly to study your actions and the method of them. And yet
      you found it a perfectly simple matter to hoodwink me whenever you chose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what respect?&rdquo; Wingrave asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every respect!&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;Let me tell you two things which
      happened to me yesterday. I met a young New York stockbroker, named
      Nesbitt, in London, and in common with all London, I suppose, by this
      time, I learnt the secret of all those anonymous contributions to the
      hospitals and other charitable causes during the last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Wingrave said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come here on purpose to tell you what I think you are,&rdquo; Aynesworth
      said. &ldquo;You are the greatest hypocrite unhanged. You affect to hate your
      fellows and to love evil-doers. You deceived the whole world, and you
      deceived me. I know you now for what you are. You conceived your evil
      plans, but when the time came for carrying them out, you funked it every
      time. You had that silly little woman on the steamer in your power, and
      you yourself, behind your own back, released her with that Marconigram to
      her husband, sent by yourself. You brought the boy Nesbitt face to face
      with ruin, and to his face you offered him no mercy. Behind his back you
      employ a lawyer to advance him your own money to pay your own debt. You
      decline to give a single penny away in charity and, as stealthily as
      possible, you give away in one year greater sums than any other man has
      ever parted with. You decline to help the poor little orphan child of the
      village organist, and secretly you have her brought up in your own home,
      and stop the sale of your pictures for the sake of the child whom you had
      only once contemptuously addressed. Can you deny any one of these things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Wingrave answered quietly, &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought you a strong man,&rdquo; Aynesworth continued, aggrieved and
      contemptuous. &ldquo;I nearly went mad with fear when I heard that it was you
      who were the self-appointed guardian of Juliet Lundy. I looked upon this
      as one more, the most diabolical of all your schemes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave rose to his feet, still and grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this interview does not interest me. Let us bring
      it to an end. I admit that I have made a great failure of my life. I admit
      that I have failed in realizing the ambitions I once confided to you. I
      came out from prison with precisely those intentions, and I was conscious
      of nothing in myself or my nature to prevent my carrying them out. It
      seems that I was mistaken. I admit all this, but I do not admit your right
      to force yourself into my presence and taunt me with my failure. You
      served me well enough, but you were easily hoodwinked, and our connection
      is at an end. I have only one thing to say to you. I am leaving this part
      of the world altogether. I shall not return. That child has some foolish
      scruples about taking any more of my money. That arises through your
      confounded interference. She is poor, almost in want. If you should fail
      her now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth interrupted with a hoarse little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wingrave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you playing the simpleton? If Juliet will not
      take your money, why should she take mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave came out from his place. He was standing now between Aynesworth
      and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do I understand that you are not going to marry
      the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Certainly not!&rdquo; Aynesworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave remained quite calm, but there was a terrible light in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, for the first time, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am glad that you are
      here. We are going to have a complete understanding before you leave this
      room. Juliet Lundy, as my ward, was, I believe, contented and happy. It
      suited you to disturb our relations, and your excuse for doing so was that
      you loved her. You took her away from me, and now you say that you do not
      intend to marry her. Be so good as to tell me what the devil you do mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth laughed a little bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but a sense of humor was always my
      undoing, and this reversal of our positions is a little odd, isn&rsquo;t it? I
      am not going to marry Juliet Lundy because she happens not to care for me
      in that way at all. My appearance is scarcely that of a joyous lover, is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave eyed him more closely. Aynesworth had certainly fallen away from
      the trim and carefully turned out young man of a few months back. He was
      paler, too, and looked older.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand this,&rdquo; Wingrave said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; Aynesworth answered bitterly. &ldquo;There is someone else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone whom I do not know about?&rdquo; Wingrave said, frowning heavily. &ldquo;Who
      is he, Aynesworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders. He said nothing. Wingrave came a step
      nearer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may as well tell me.&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;for I shall postpone my
      journey until I know the whole truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my secret,&rdquo; Aynesworth answered. &ldquo;Ask her yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Wingrave declared, &ldquo;I will. I shall return to London
      tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary,&rdquo; Aynesworth remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that she is here?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aynesworth drew him towards the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you shall ask her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave hesitated for a moment. An odd nervousness seemed to have taken
      possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand this, Aynesworth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why is she here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and ask her your question,&rdquo; Aynesworth said. &ldquo;Perhaps you will
      understand then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wingrave went down the path which led to the walled garden and the sea.
      The tall hollyhocks brushed against his knees; the air, as mild as
      springtime, was fragrant with the perfume of late roses. Wingrave took no
      note of these things. Once more he seemed to see coming up the path the
      little black-frocked child, with the pale face and the great sad eyes; it
      was she indeed who rose so swiftly from the hidden seat. Then Wingrave
      stopped short for he felt stirring within him all the long repressed
      madness of his unlived manhood. It was the weakness against which he had
      fought so long and so wearily, triumphant now, so that his heart beat like
      a boy&rsquo;s, and the color flamed into his cheeks. And all the time she was
      coming nearer, and he saw that the child had become a woman, and it seemed
      to him that all the joy of life was alight in her face, and the one
      mysterious and wonderful secret of her sex was shining softly out of her
      eager eyes. So that, after all, when they met, Wingrave asked her no
      questions. She came into his arms with all the graceful and perfect
      naturalness of a child who has wandered a little away from home....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too old for you, dear,&rdquo; he said presently, as they wandered about
      the garden, &ldquo;much too old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Age,&rdquo; she answered softly, &ldquo;what is that? What have we to do with the
      years that are past? It is the years to come only which we need consider,
      and to think of them makes me almost tremble with happiness. You are much
      too rich and too wonderful a personage for a homeless orphan like me;
      but,&rdquo; she added, tucking her arm through his with a contented little sigh,
      &ldquo;I have you, and I shall not let you go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
